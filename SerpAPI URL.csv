I’ve written a few blogs for our website and in most of them, I find myself preaching the importance of early contractor involvement. In fact, I doubt there’s an article on our website about preconstruction that doesn’t discuss the considerable benefits of hiring your contractor as early as possible in a project. In just my own project experience, I can think of countless examples where our feedback provided during preconstruction helped add value through improved schedules, budgets, quality, etc. But today I think what might be more impactful and relevant is to highlight how early contractor involvement can safeguard projects against current challenges in our industry.

Unpredictability. That’s the biggest challenge our industry is currently facing. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused uncertainty in everything from materials procurement to our everyday health and safety. We outline the cumulative effect of COVID-19 on our industry "

While COVID-19 has severely impacted most sectors of the construction industry, data center construction continues to climb at unprecedented rates. As the pandemic continues, the exponential increase in data usage is adding increased demand for storage capacity. Data center providers are faced with the challenge of how to manage this growing demand, while also expanding capacity. Providers are considering large scale capital investments to either finance a new site, or to increase the density of an existing location.

Construction trends historically follow the processes that prioritize speed and efficiency. This has shortened the average data center build and deployment time. Contractors and their partners, including owners and designers, are finding new ways to be innovative to keep up with the rapid speed of implementation. The result has been a tidal wave of pre-fabrication and modular construction in the data center market.

One of the key factors in minimizing downtime and providing uninterrupted service is maintaining a reliable power distribution system.

Switchgear—a term that collectively describes the equipment used to control, regulate, and switch circuits on and off in an electrical system—historically functioned mainly as short-circuit protection. Thanks to the raging demand for capacity, today’s data center switchgear is evolving into a critical component in supporting high availability for data center tenants.

In a modular data center, low-voltage distribution switchgear acts as a larger version of the circuit breaker panel in a home: Power enters the data center through switchgear and is routed and rerouted to distribute the load between power sources as needed. In the event of a power failure, distribution switches from utility to backup power, to minimize or prevent downtime.

As in any other industry, the larger the project, the more complex its needs, leading to more opportunities for delays. One of the most detrimental outcomes of construction project delays is their tendency to rack up financial costs, leading to budgetary constraints and reduced profit margins. This reality makes the role of the project manager or contractor that much more important when it comes to anticipating and predicting where the delays can and will occur.

Knowing where construction delays occur and how to avoid them is a crucial aspect of construction management. Below are the top 10 causes of construction delays for contractors to be aware of.

1. Improper Upfront Planning

In fact, the sheer number of moving parts, and variables inside and outside of a contractor’s control, make delays almost inevitable for many projects.

The statistics make for grim reading. According to a KPMG report, only 25% of construction projects are completed within 10% of their original deadlines. And the bigger the project, the more likely it is to run into significant delays. Large projects generally take 20% longer than expected to finish, while an eye-watering 98% of ‘mega projects’ become delayed or over budget, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

Extreme frustration and profit's ticking down like a timer are what contractors typically envision when someone utters those dreadful words….There has been a delay. They immediately start thinking about how this will impact them, especially since there may be several workers expecting to start on a project in a couple months. This is a common occurrence in the industry, which often leaves contractors scrambling to find work for their staff to fill the gaps left by construction delays.

Business, after all, is not as usual when unplanned, external factors disrupt workflows, bring assembly lines to a screeching halt, and force teams to have to rethink processes quickly to make up for lost time.

A survey in the auto industry, for example, revealed that the average monetary impact of production downtime was $22k for each minute of unplanned manufacturing workflow interruptions. The IT industry, similarly, can relate to these downtime-related financial stressors; whether they’re due to something as benign as human error or more worrying cybersecurity incidents, the overall estimated cost per hour of enterprise downtime worldwide in 2019 was between $301k and $400k!

Construction projects are invariably tight in terms of budget and timelines. The very nature of the industry, which is highly competitive and often runs on razor-thin profit margins, dictates that construction projects are negotiated and planned with strict deadlines. However, these deadlines often come under pressure due to unforeseen factors such as inclement weather or sudden demands by the client or general contractor. The result can be delays that can have serious implications, financial, logistical and otherwise, for construction companies.

A leading reason for delays on construction sites are maintenance-related issues such as equipment malfunctions or machinery breakdowns. These unfortunate and unwanted issues can indicate that prevailing maintenance systems are dysfunctional and, thus, counter-productive. Even safety-related incidents on construction sites can be due to machinery or equipment (such as scaffold"

Disruption on a construction project may occur during periods when the contractor performed his work in a less efficient manner than was originally planned – it could be due to various reasons like intermittent working, out-of-sequence work or extended working hours, etc. Disruption can manifest within a construction project which has not been subject to critical delay i.e., disruption can apply to sub-critical delays.

Disruption claims relate to additional costs incurred by the contractor due to increased expenditure on labour and equipment, and not necessarily extra time (i.e., critical delay) spent on site owing to an excusable delay event.

It happens often enough that construction departments in sectors ranging from corporate real estate to healthcare to retail have come to expect it. However, this does not have to be the case.

Organizations that participate in construction projects should be looking at the underlying reasons for construction delays, understanding why and how they occur. So, what causes construction project delays?

Through our research and work with industry-leading companies, we have uncovered five of the most significant reasons for delays:

1. Lowballed projected timelines

Schedule Predictability of Construction Projects While Reducing Costs

The construction industry’s challenge in meeting cost and schedule budgets is greatly affected by rework. A regional initiative in the early 2000s was tasked with developing a simple tool to capture and analyze field rework at major industrial construction projects. This was then applied at a production facility with a large number of smaller projects progressing at the same time. The same tool was also modified to track delays in the construction work caused by factors other than rework. Early results were adequate in identifying the primary causes of rework and delays, as well as initiating some early mitigation measures.

Risk, specifically in construction, comes in many forms, and many stakeholders attempt to manage it.

A current perception in the construction industry is that owners/end-users are dissatisfied with time, cost, and quality on the job. Their diagnosis is that there is an inefficient and costly procurement chain. The proposed remedy is that owners/end-users can manage risk and improve time, cost, and quality on the job by directly purchasing material and removing the middlemen (e.g., the electrical contractor).

ELECTRI International commissioned research to be conducted by MCA, Inc., in 2004 and again in 2018 to shed light on the actual cost drivers of construction projects.

Michael Mabee has repeatedly raised concerns about the security of the critical electric sector.

A report released last month by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), states that the “Deployment of utility-scale solar and wind technologies in remote areas is likely to require ultra-high-voltage transmission lines to move the power to cities. China is the world’s leading supplier of advanced grid components for ultra-high-voltage systems, such as transformers, circuit breakers, and inverters, which we assess creates cyber vulnerability risks.”

Electrical Switchgear Risk Assessment : In an electric power system, switchgear is the combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgears are used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear faults downstream. This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the electricity supply

One of the basic functions of switchgear is protection, which is interruption of short-circuit and overload fault currents while maintaining service to unaffected circuits. Switchgear also provides isolation of circuits from power supplies. Switchgear is also used to enhance system availability by allowing more than one source to feed a load.

Switchgear can be classified on the basis of voltage level in to the following

Low voltage (LV) Switchgear

Medium voltage (MV) Switchgear

High voltage (HV) Switchgear

Not only does modernization allow companies to better compete for a finite pool of customers, but it enables the organization’s employees to improve operational efficiency and safety. In the area of industrial plant power distribution, for example, switchgear modernization can represent up to 30% in cost savings due to decreased production downtime and reduced equipment site work costs.

Running operations on power distribution equipment that exceeds 15 years of age places the organization at risk for both catastrophic downtime and rapidly increasing maintenance costs. After 10 years, most manufacturers begin to phase out their supply of spare parts. If performance incidents occur that require parts replacement, that repair will take longer (increased mean-time-to-repair) and the parts, if they can be located, will be significantly more expensive to purchase.

Projects are becoming more complex, the trading environment is extremely competitive, and customers are naturally wanting to keep their costs to a minimum. In order to stand strong, manufacturers must streamline their processes and identify where the most time-savings can be made. After all, the quicker a panel can be built, the more projects the team can take on.

Manual panel wiring takes time

Research shows that the panel wiring stage of building a control panel (preparing wires, reading drawings for routing point and termination) is the most time-intensive and can take up to 49% of the overall time. This is a result of most companies still using very traditional and manual methods to complete the task. These methods require extensive knowledge of reading schedules, and even with experience can still result in errors.

In a recent survey by the National Asso­ciation of Manufacturers, almost 80% of manufacturers anticipated financial and operational consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic, there was a notable shift from global to more local economies due in large part to international trade tensions, increased foreign wages, quality control and other factors; the pandemic only intensified this trend. Now, many industries are looking to bring supply chains (critical component/raw material produc­tion) closer to home, resulting in manufacturers building new production facilities or expanding existing facilities as a means of improving supply chain resiliency. This changing landscape is push­ing companies to re-evaluate their processes and production capacities.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a sudden pivot to remote workplaces and worldwide reliance on the internet, which became a lifeline for millions of individuals’ business, personal and social lives.

Another side effect of the pandemic was a severe disruption to the global supply chain, which has made it difficult for data center owners to build enough facilities to keep pace with the demand.

While not a new concept, modular data centers are experiencing elevated popularity, as more owners realize the value of premanufactured construction for data centers of every type—from tiny, temporary units to hyperscale facilities and every use case in between. One of the major advantages associated with the modular approach, and the most necessary to expedite your project’s deployment, is the ability to shift the labor and material procurement off site.

If you’re trying to test a time delay relay, there’s an easy way to do it. First of all, make sure the device is turned off and unplugged from its power source. Then get an electric probe or any electrical testing tool that has two metal ends (one small & one large) so that both can touch at once inside of your circuit board. You’ll want to connect these probes where each end should go into either side of the “on” coil on the time delay relay (the larger probe should be connected in between).

When doing this correctly, you will see a back EMF when electricity flows through wires and other conducting materials like metals. This shows up as a temporary reverse flow of electricity when you move your probe from one coil to the other. If it does not show up, then this means that your time delay relay is either defective or has a broken wire in its circuit board somewhere.

Between fluctuations in costs of raw materials, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions, manufacturers face unprecedented times. For most, 2021 has proven more challenging than 2020. Rising costs of inputs and inflexible contract pricing have some manufacturers in the unenviable position of shipping at a loss. However, there are a number of tools manufacturers can use to stave off the negative impacts of shortages and the resulting increase in the price of raw materials and component parts. One of these tools is the addition of a price escalation clause in contracts with customers.

A price escalation clause permits the manufacturer to increase the price of the end product to the customer in the event of a meaningful rise in the cost of raw materials or component parts required to manufacture said product. Absent a price escalation clause in a time where co"

The home was completely new (all systems new). My Load Center and breakers are Eaton products. I have had to replace 6 breakers (about $60 each plus electrician labor). In each case, the breaker in question started to trip with a load far below rated amperage and then would ultimately have an orange indicator continuous (and sometimes wouldn't reset). Is it common for 5 or more breakers in a new load center to fail? I feel like the batch of breakers I got must have been bad -- none of the new breakers which replaced the old ones have failed again. I'm concerned that ALL of the breakers in my load pane will fail over time.

Eaton says they have a lifetime warranty on the breakers but I didn't buy them -- they were installed by my builders electrician (not sure of who that was).

Any advice on how to handle?"

We will discuss the general principles for how electricity is moved from the utility lines to a convenience outlet in a room. The system components vary depending on the size of the building so we will address systems for small and large buildings.

Electricity from the Power Company

Electric utilities transmit power from the power plant most efficiently at very high voltages. In the United States, power companies provide electricity to medium or large buildings at 13,800 volts (13.8kV). For small commercial buildings or residential customers, power companies lower the voltage with a transformer on a power pole or mounted on the ground. From there, the electricity is fed through a meter and into the building.

Power Distribution in Small Buildings

Small commercial or residential buildings have a very simple power distribution system. The utility will own the transformer, which will "

Because of the very large electrodynamic forces that impact the compact winding structure, passage of short-circuit current is an extreme stress for transformers. These internal forces are in proportion with the square of current and the inverse of conductor distance. From EPRI Transformer Industry-Wide Database (IDB), inadequate short-circuit strength is by far the main reason of transformer failure. Moreover, KEMA Labs has conducted almost 400 short-circuit withstand tests on power transformers with power ratings between 25 to 600 MVA, up to 800 kV, in the past 25 years, confirming that around 25% does not pass the short-circuit test as specified in IEC 60076-5.

The existing distribution systems (DSs) nowadays perform well mainly based on the past decades’ requirements and standards, but they lack the ability to meet the upcoming challenges. Some of these challenges are the persistent load growth, alongside the increased integration of DGs and low-carbon technologies (LCTs). These new necessary adoptions in turn increase the number of variables and constraints that must be considered during system planning. Moreover, it has to account for the unexpected faults that may occur in the network that will degrade the system performance. Hence, adequate planning for the DS is required to cope with these problems. The increase in the load demand and the modernization of the DS has made it essential to expand the DS along with proper and detailed planning.

Delays are particularly troublesome in construction as they can lead to a rise in costs as well as a reduction of productivity.

Luckily, there are precautions that can be taken to avoid and reduce construction delays. Below are 5 common construction delays and how to avoid them:

#1 WEATHER DELAYS

Weather-related construction delays can’t be avoided altogether, but they can be prepared for. Beyond simply checking forecasts, you should schedule your projects according to their ability to be completed in different weather types.

Heat

While hot days won’t always impact construction, extreme heat can cause problems for both crew and products. Materials may not cure the way they’re supposed to, and it may not be safe for crew to work outside for extended periods of time. On hotter days, focus on projects at indoor or shaded sites, or provide frequen"

All electrical boxes and cables are installed with proper support, the wall is left open on at least one side, no insulation has been installed that would hinder the inspector from seeing all wiring methods in the wall.

As an inspector, do your best to bring up anything that you know will hold up construction progress as early on as possible.

Some electrical contractors may be used to working in a specific county or even another state and may not be familiar with local city or county inspection requirements. Try to make the electrician aware of any local rules or ordinances related to construction readiness and inspection procedures.

The authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) over the project will expect specific things to be completed before each inspection is scheduled by the permit holder. Below are a few examples:

Underground electrical inspection. Trench at proper burial depth, trench left open and not covered, conduit or cables (suitable for wet "

No matter the cause, there are some winning strategies to mitigate maintenance and construction project delays.

“I encourage clients to tackle any delay with the three p’s: patience, practicality and a plan,” shared Cox. Chuckling, he added, “There is one p that is best avoided: panic.”

Christopher went on to explain that contractors and project managers are sometimes tempted to cut corners to make up time. This rarely pays off and can backfire, leading to even longer delays and higher costs. For example, eliminating safety meetings and training can dramatically increase the risk of injury, and the statistics around workplace safety are sobering. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020 there were 174,100 cases of construction injuries which equates to one in every 10 workers. The costs associated with a workplace injury can be staggering including workers compensation, medical treatment, lost productivity, project d"
2022,construction project delays due to electrical equipment,Six Methods to Reduce Construction Supply Chain Lead ...,https://www.vizientinc.com/newsroom/blogs/2022/six-methods-to-reduce-construction-supply-chain-lead-times,Six Methods to Reduce Construction Supply Chain Lead Times,"Since large electrical and mechanical equipment requires components from other suppliers and are oftentimes shipped from overseas, lead times have increased tremendously amid an already constrained supply chain. For example, large electrical generators typically took 35 to 40 weeks for delivery from an approved submittal — today, the lead time is an astounding 65 to 75 weeks. The same is true for custom air handling units, which in the past took around 15 weeks from submittal approval to delivery. Now the lead time is closer to 30 weeks.

So how can health systems better handle these types of delays? Below, we discuss six methods to reduce construction supply chain lead times.

Supplier standardization

One of the best methods to reduce lead times is to standardize the materials and equipment an organization procures and installs while establishing meaningful and strategic supplier/partner relationships. Healthcare supply chain departments’ primary objectives are to standardize clinica"
2022,construction project delays due to electrical equipment,Top Reasons for Delays in Construction Projects - GoCodes,https://gocodes.com/reasons-for-construction-project-delays/,Top Reasons for Delays in Construction Projects,"Delays have long plagued the construction industry. Reasons for this are as varied and complex as the construction process itself.

Regardless of possible categorizations, some causes of project delays are more common than others and can affect construction projects of any type and size.

Without further ado, here are the six usual suspects.

Changes In Project Scope

According to a meta-analysis of causes of project delays, changes in project scope are among the most prevalent reasons for delays in construction projects.

That’s not surprising since the scope covers project objectives and deliverables, i.e., everything that should be done to consider a construction project completed.

Here’s an example of a project scope for constructing a new home with a tentative total project cost and a more defined timeline.

As you can see, a project scope will define at least the following:

overall project objective (e.g., constructing a home)

project deliverables (i.e., what the contractor sh"

Project delays are not only a nuisance, they can be quite costly as well. For example, according to the Construction Industry Institute, rework is estimated to represent between 2% and 20% of total costs. Rework also extends the project timeline, which can have rippling effects across the entire project lifecycle.

Disputes also have a negative impact on your project’s bottom line. According to the 2021 Global Construction Disputes Report from Arcadis, the global average cost of disputes rose dramatically in 2020, even though the average length of a dispute shortened. Often disputes occur due to a lack of visibility into project data, impaired communication channels, and unexpected changes. These are not insurmountable, but they will end up costing your business, if not addressed.

Recruiting and retaining qualified workers is an ongoing challenge that can significantly impair your ability to meet project deadlines and adhere to the agreed upon scope of work. St"

The appearance of COVID-19 in early 2020 quickly led to factory shutdowns and material shortages in everything from steel to computer chips, resulting in delivery and project delays and outright stoppages. While there were the brief beginnings of supply line restoration, most industrial contracting companies are seeing a return to long lead times for project materials.

The cycle continues

Industrial contracting projects are caught up in a new and vicious cycle of extended material delivery times and continued cost increases, according to Deloitte’s 2022 Engineering and Construction Industry Outlook.

Clamping down on cost and maximizing efficiency is the secret to smoother operations. Taking control of your fuel is one of the simplest ways to reduce risk and overruns. Below are three ways to help reduce downtime and delays.

Plan ahead

Productivity is all about controlling costs and staying on schedule. Fuel is one of the biggest operating costs on a jobsite, and not having a ready supply in the right place at the right time can turn a profitable project into a loss-making one.

Ordering fuel in bulk means keeping a ready supply onsite at all times, extending your runtimes and keeping you up and running. Tanks like our TransCube Global offer complete flexibility, keeping your fuel safe and secure no matter where it’s stored onsite. You can refuel equipment and generators as quickly as possible, and keep track of how much fuel you’re using throughout your project.

A fault caused by a worker or by external factors can lead to an arc flash, which can result in a worker being exposed to dangerous levels of heat, pressure, sound, and light. The end goal of an arc flash study is to quantify the incident energy level at each equipment location so that workers can best make decisions on how to safely interact with the equipment.

An arc flash study builds upon short-circuit and coordination studies and uses many of the same data points. Knowing the available bolted fault cur- rents at equipment locations (and how long those fault currents may last) makes it possible to determine how much incident energy someone may be ex- posed to during an arc flash event. This is determined using procedures outlined in IEEE 1584-2018 – Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations.

A shortage of distribution system transformers is depleting replacement equipment stockpiles and delaying or canceling some electrification projects, the electric utility sector warned federal lawmakers in a November letter. The industry’s ability to quickly restore power following storms is also at risk, they said.

A group of lawmakers led by Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., is urging the government to authorize $2.1 billion in disaster supplemental funding to address the shortage of electrical transformers and complementary grid security technologies through the Defense Production Act.

The delays are “ubiquitous, across the country,” Joy Ditto, president and CEO of the American Public Power Association, said in an interview.

Unfortunately, the current construction industry is being severely impacted by major challenges within the electrical gear industry driven by demand, labor issues, and electrical component shortages. Critical switchgear components such as switchboards, distribution panels, and heavy-duty circuit breakers have historically taken four to six months to receive. Over the past year, lead times on these items have increased to a minimum of 12 months, and quoted lead times of 14-18 months are becoming the standard.

Vendor risk has the power to impact an organization’s reputation, ESG (environmental, social, governance) initiatives, and information security. Similarly, vendors can affect a project’s performance due to their financial and credit situations, legal and organizational compliance issues, geo-political scenarios, and general decision-making. These vendor risks, among others, are here to stay and are continuing to grow—with the ability to negatively impact owners and contractors alike.

Awareness of vendor risk is critical for owners, as they are not isolated from risks even though construction managers and general contractors are typically the ones who directly engage vendors. Vendors can be classified into general tiers as shown in Figure 1 below.1 Tiers range from high project impact, and therefore higher risk (vendors in tier 1), to non-critical vendors or suppliers with low impact and risk in the nth tier.

Today’s volume of information exchanged between construction teams is increasing as we become more “connected.” While innovative, this trend puts a lot of stress on centralized organizations, especially in the construction industry, where miscommunication can snowball into worse dilemmas on site.

The symptoms of issues on-site are pretty straightforward. After a busy week on a construction site, part of the project team comes back on the weekend to catch up on backlog emails, un-processed change orders, and RFIs. If this is considered normalized in your team, it means that you and the rest of your staff cannot process the information generated fast enough.

Because requests aren’t processed until the weekend, the communication cycle turnarounds increase by extended days, slowing down the construction teams on site. When one of those unprocessed items happens to be on the critical path, you can end up delaying the entire project.

The impact of construction delays has a major effect on the overall project. These delays can be caused by various factors, some of which include: a lack of materials, weather conditions, and labor shortages. Delays also mean more costs as you will need to pay for subcontractors who are not working at full capacity due to these issues. This article explains how contractors calculate their costs for each day that goes by without completion so you can understand what might happen if something does go wrong during construction time frames.

What is a construction delay and its consequences?

Construction delays are the time between when a project is supposed to be completed and when it actually is completed. Construction delays can be caused by a number of factors, including weather conditions and other factors that are beyond the control of the contractor or project manager.

Just as the pandemic seemed to be easing around the world, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China’s draconian new lockdowns made everything worse. Generation, transmission and distribution companies are all reporting problems.

""This issue will be with us for at least the next 12 to 18 months,"" says Electricity Networks Association chief executive Graeme Peters.

The lead times for parts and raw materials are contributing to equipment delays, with some component suppliers reporting lead times of more than 52 weeks, Peters says. Impacted components include electrical steel, transformer oil, bushings, plate steel and aluminium wire. Local supply chains are also under pressure. Some New Zealand-based suppliers are also experiencing labour shortages, which is impacting delivery times, Peters says.

They are highly complex and physically demanding, varying from chemical plants and production environments to plastic and rubber facilities. As a result, electrical contractors with experience and expertise matters more in these projects than in many other fields. If “company fit” isn’t one of the top criteria for securing the contract, the parties can run into countless problems (e.g., budget and schedule overruns, facility downtime, equipment damage, and failure) and, most concerning, accidents.

When electrical contractors are hired for an industrial project, the GC or Owner who hired them should feel confident they made the right decision. Why? Because time and time again, leading contractors require the capabilities to perform excellent work in ultra-demanding industrial environments.

Two years later, these effects are still being felt and businesses have had to adapt to this changing landscape. One of the largest problems faced by electric construction companies is the rising costs of materials as a result of a supply shortage nationwide.

Prices for raw materials, such as steel and copper, doubled from 2020 to 2021. Additionally, all major transportation methods have experienced delays in shipping due to a combination of increased demand and a loss of labor. To keep business running, electric construction companies, such as ours, have been forced to get creative in the materials that we use in order to keep projects running smoothly and on a timeline.

Now, almost 20 years later, it’s clear they were right. Employers have struggled to fill electrician positions for years — long before national labor shortages made headlines this past year.

But what’s causing the electrician shortage, and what’s changed with the COVID-19 pandemic? As we enter 2022, here’s an overview of the current state of the electrician shortage and what the future may hold.

Why Is There a Shortage of Electricians?

Like many economic issues, the electrician shortage is the result of a mismatch between supply and demand.

On the supply side, not enough younger electricians are entering the industry as experienced electricians are retiring. On the demand side, more electricians will be needed to meet the ever-increasing electricity needs of our nation.

From a big-picture perspective, there are three main causes behind the electr"

Main causes of electrician shortage:

Electrical demand, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statics 3 , indicates that electrician jobs are expected to grow 9% from 2020 to 2030, therefore, 66,200 new jobs will need to be filled. There is a significant increase in demand for areas like residential and light commercial EV charging installation and service, as well as for solar and solar battery storage, installation and integration. Consumers are using more electricity than before and the overall need to install, service and maintain the electrical systems is immense. Current electrical consumption in the U.S. is expected to grow by 14%. 4

The potential consequences all stem from a scarcity of transformers, which are needed to hook up retail customers like homeowners to power lines. The transformers usually hang from utility poles or are mounted on concrete pads and enclosed by metal cases. They’re a basic but critically important piece of equipment for delivering electricity.

In recent months, though, utilities have been reporting wait times of over a year to get transformers, and say costs have skyrocketed from $3,000 to $4,000 per transformer before the shortage, to more than $20,000 each now.

In a booming town like Roseville, California, north of Sacramento, the transformer shortage threatens to slow the pace of new subdivisions being constructed. The city has been adding"

In April, the US construction industry had roughly 440,000 job openings, and the US manufacturing industry had more than one million—the highest levels recorded since industry-level jobs data were first collected. This prompts the question: Who will fill the hundreds of thousands of additional jobs we estimate the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) will create each year (peaking above 300,000 in 2027 and 2028) across the construction value chain in the next decade?

The answer to this question is critical, and not just for the construction sector. The BIL is poised to escalate labor demand, starting with outlays flowing to states, agencies, and authorities to fund portfolios of projects. Because each project relies on a chain of companies spanning engineering, materials fabrication, distribution, freight, and construction, any shortage of materials or labor at any point along the chain may cause delays, dr"

This puts the construction industry squarely in the middle of a perfect storm of issues that are causing significant problems for many contractors.

So, we’ll look at what factors are affecting the availability of construction materials right now and what your business can do to deal with a shortage of materials.

What Is Affecting Construction Materials Availability

In short, it all started with the pandemic that led to factory closures and initial supply disruptions.

As it turns out, buildings don’t get built without materials. Delays due to shortages and supply chain demand can quickly and negatively impact a project schedule, potentially leading to increased costs to recover the schedule and, in some cases, liquidated damages if the project is not completed on time. Understanding the material climate, planning and projecting ahead, and transparent communication are ways to get ahead of and mitigate these negative impacts.

Understanding the Climate

Supply chain demand and disruption is a hot topic in the industry today. As states are now fully reopening following the COVID-19 shutdowns and construction has ratcheted back up, contractors have quickly discovered that many materials are simply not available in the timeframes they’re accustomed to.

The Effect of COVID-19 on the Construction Industry

In times of boom, bust, or even war, the construction industry is accustomed to pricing volatility. But the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on construction material costs is unlike anything the industry has seen before.

As “non-essential” manufacturing businesses shut their doors, supplies dwindled, and prices skyrocketed. Now, as the U.S. economy comes roaring back and demand continues to outpace supply, the construction industry remains saddled with high prices and delays.

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) of Harvard University, the price of structural steel more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. And lumber’s retail price hit an all-time high – up 323%.

For example, a supply chain can’t run efficiently, reliably, and smoothly when you spend more on raw materials, energy, and transportation.

Consequently, companies experience production line bottlenecks, shipping delays, and warehouse stockouts. The problems worsen as inflation becomes unbearable, leading to financial recession. Companies can rely on modern technologies and cutting-edge tools to improve their strategies. Read on!

What is Supply Chain Inflation?

The primary cause of inflation in the supply chain is an imbalance or lack of transparency between supply and demand. The overall price increase causes significant issues for companies and consumers because people do not have enough purchasing power.

At the same time, consumers receive fewer goods, products, and services with the same amount of money. Inflation affects"

In addition to extending existing tax credits, the IRA restores the option for developers, including solar and other renewable technologies, to use either the Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) or the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”). Solar developers, for example, choosing to switch from the ITC to PTC may need to address new concerns from tax equity investors, especially meeting production assurances and maximizing energy generation for the energy facility. For renewable energy facilities using the PTC, the IRA may raise new concerns from tax equity investors and developers.

This shows the vulnerability of our shipping and overland trade routes, which demands robust mechanisms to address the resulting inflation. While the eurozone has seen inflation rate of over 9% as of August 2022, the worst hit countries are Spain (~10%), Germany (~9%), and Estonia (~24%).

Impact on supply chains

2022,inflation and electrical equipment procurement,How inflation affects the supply chain,https://www.mecalux.com/blog/supply-chain-inflation,How inflation affects the supply chain,"Supply chain inflation directly impacts logistics and manufacturing costs, e.g., spending on raw materials, energy and goods transport.

In an inflationary environment, the supply chain might not run smoothly. And this could result in shipping delays, production line bottlenecks and warehouse stockouts among other obstacles. Nevertheless, there are strategies that can help to mitigate some of the effects of inflation. Companies tend to rely on technology solutions to improve their planning. This enables them to anticipate possible disruptions or gain real-time visibility of stock to fulfil product demand.

What’s supply chain inflation?

Inflation is a phenomenon caused by an imbalance between supply and demand, leading to a general increase in the price of products and services over a given period of time. This overall surge in prices means that people’s purchasing power is diminished: with the same amount of money, you obtain fewer goods and services.

Hardware products are built by managing intricate overlapping dependencies in design and manufacturing over a long development cycle. Because many steps depend on the completion of the preceding one in a decidedly unagile way, any disruption to that process, such as scaling an unproven new technology, shortages of raw materials, factory labor disputes, or transportation challenges, will often cause frustrating delays. COVID-19, the chip shortage, and other supply chain challenges have only made schedules harder to meet and, as a result, more difficult to predict when a product will actually ship. In this article, we will break down the top reasons why hardware products get delayed and why you may want to plan ahead before making a purchase this year.

The Rental Market Has Become the Go-To Channel for Electric Construction Equipment,"By Lori Lovely View Profile

Jobsites are populated by more electric equipment than ever before, driven largely by increased demand for a smaller carbon footprint and sustainability goals. Electric equipment is generally quieter than diesel-powered machines and offers the benefit of zero emissions. These characteristics nominate electric machines for urban and indoor applications, nighttime work, food, school, hospital and agricultural settings, high-dust environments where sparking is a concern and jobsites with environmental requirements. Lower vibration improves the operator’s experience, while lower noise levels increase safety by permitting workers to communicate more easily.

As with most new technology, costs for electric-powered machines are initially higher than their diesel-powered counterparts. Thus, Brent Coffey, director of product line management for Sunbelt Rentals, says he believes “rental will be the channel that drives most of the adoption of electric equipment into t"

Whether you accept the potential role jobsite electrification could play in climate change mitigation or not, electric power is headed to a jobsite near you in one form or another, and is expected to continue to be an increasingly larger part of construction’s future. But to what degree it will be fully implemented in the U.S. is uncertain.

“Electrification is coming,” stated Carl Gustaf Goransson, a corporate senior advisor and former CNH Industrial executive, in a panel discussion hosted in early February by Ritchie Bros. He cited production models introduced in 2021 that are already in operation globally. “Machines are going to market and they are operating very well – good feedback from the customers, and they know they’re meeting the regulations that are coming more and more.”

Sometimes project delays are contractor based such as poor planning and management, insufficient resources, or delays in the supply of materials. Often the delays are due to weather patterns.

Delays can have a serious financial impact on a project. They can reduce the contractor’s annual revenue figures or even jeopardize the contractor’s credibility to deliver a project, hence losing clients. In worst-case scenarios, the firm could be ruined by liquidated damages. In the UK, project delays have a 15% impact on the value of the project (see image below) with an estimated 1.58 trillion euros loss on a global industrial scale.

In the face of supply chain delays, engineers and architects can strategically navigate these challenges by fostering tighter collaboration between their electrical and mechanical teams. By encouraging the mechanical team to promptly finalize equipment sizes, engineers can expedite the downstream electrical processes, mitigating the impact of supply issues. While electrical systems often follow the lead of other trades, adopting a proactive approach can create a buffer against disruptions. There’s more than one way to wire a switch and more than one way to design a system.

One effective strategy to reduce lead times involves rethinking equipment choices. For instance, when faced with a client's request for a single large piece of equipment with a daunting 52-week lead time, our engineers explore alternatives. Given that smaller units tend to have shorter lead times, a successful solution could include ordering two smaller units that fulfill the same purpose."

Although the data center sector was just one of many industries affected, the extensive variety of the often complex electrical and mechanical equipment involved exacerbated supply chain problems.

Engine generators illustrate the problem: they typically comprise hundreds of constituent parts shipped from at least a dozen countries spanning North America, Europe and Asia. Shortages of seemingly ordinary components, such as voltage regulators, air filters, valves or battery terminals, can lead to major delays in delivery. Even when the production of data center equipment (such as lead-acid batteries and fiber optic cables) is relatively localized, pricing and availability will be subject to changing dynamics in global markets.

Managing Supply Chain Challenges

For the past few years, supply chain has been at the forefront of manufacturers’ and distributors’ minds. Construction Managers’ (CM) needs for materials and supplies have increased, which is creating a demand that is straining the supply chain and increasing the costs of goods. Because materials are in such high demand, it is clear that CMs need to prioritize visibility and resiliency in their supply chain. No one can predict the next supply chain disruption, but engaging the right CM there are solutions with preventative action to help ease the potential struggle and streamline operations, keeping projects running smoothly.

Preconstruction Communication

Getting ahead of potential supply chain woes, starts with strategic planning with the CM’s preconstruction team. The preconstruction team starts the initial planning stages of any project. It is at this stage that the collective team develops schedules and budgets, validates drawings thr"

A Sable Homes home being constructed near Kent City is framed in and ready for drywall and other interior work. But to do that work, the home needs electricity, Bitely said.



“A furnace doesn’t run without constant power. You can’t drywall without it freezing and then it will fall apart. Then you’re stuck. You can only go so far in the building process without constant heat,” Bitely said in his interview with WOOD TV8.



For this particular house near Kent City, the electricity has to be run underground to the site off 22 Mile Road. That requires the installation of a ground-level transformer.

This is the third post in a three-part series on disruption. The first post discusses the definition of disruption, three general principals associated with disruption, and how disruption is different from delay, and the second post discusses noncompensable and compensable disruption.

Disruption to a contractor’s operations usually results in productivity loss and, almost inevitably, a loss of momentum in the work. Productivity loss is a typical result of disruption because in the end, more labor and equipment hours will be required to do the same work. To illustrate, consider a simple and common disruption such as unknown and unanticipated underground utilities that are either misplaced or not shown in the contract drawings. Also, imagine that a pipelaying crew of laborers, pipefitters, and equipment operators, with an assigned spread of equipment, is proceeding consistently with the contractor’s estimated progre"

However, talent competition is fierce, with many companies vying for the same pool of skilled workers.

Additionally, high-turnover rates as employees switch jobs for better compensation and benefits remains a significant challenge. This lack of skilled workers can lead to quality issues in the manufacturing process, affecting the overall product quality. An IPC survey found that more than 70 percent of electronics manufacturers have reported a shortage of skilled workers. Similarly, in a survey by Robert Half Technology, 49 percent of IT managers said they lost an employee due to salary issues in 2022.

This scarcity of skilled labor can hinder a company’s ability to meet customer demand, causing delays in production and missing revenue targets.

Demand for electrical components has increased, as industries focus on electrical conversions to meet net-zero targets. This has placed a strain on the sector as manufacturers struggle to meet the high demand amid labor difficulties and certain raw material shortages.



A 2023 Cushman & Wakefield sentiment survey of over 70 general contractors (GCs) in the Americas showed some improved views on costs and timelines over 2022 levels. However, improved cost sentiment belies increasing labor costs in a labor-constrained market. Sentiment improvement is most likely a result of deceleration in construction and building costs, which are not increasing as steeply as they were in mid-2022. In April of 2022, building costs increased 16% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis; this slowed to 6.4% in April of 2023—still elevated but increasing "

Experts predict COVID-19 will have long-term ramifications for many aspects of the U.S. construction industry, including lead time extensions. In this report, we will take a brief look at some of the recent changes to construction lead times and then, at the end, offer several practical recommendations to help you avoid unexpected lead time extensions.

Lead times are a measure of the amount of time that elapses between initiating a process and completing that process. On construction projects, lead times typically refer to the amount of time that elapses between placing an order for an item and its delivery to the project site, but it can also refer to the time required for the preparation of drawings, plant hires, approvals processes, and so on. 1

• The power sector is one of the major drivers of the demand in the global switchgear market.

• OEMs of switchgear consider that the surge in demand for switchgear is not sustainable, which is why they are not even pushing for a second shift at the manufacturing facility, let alone adding another production line.

Owing to a range of factors, demand for switchgear has increased in the global switchgear market post-Covid, which has, in turn, increased the prices of switchgear as well. The surge in the price is a global phenomenon, whereas the shortage is more pronounced in the US as compared to Europe, as the US lacks a local supply chain.

Deciding to expand into the switchgear market was driven by two main factors:

First, we noticed that lead times for switchgear were increasing exponentially, causing delays to our clients’ projects. “The current lead time for switchgear can be as high as 40-50 weeks. You’re basically looking at a year,” explained Nick Gunter, the Winn-Marion Switchgear Team Lead. “Right now, the average lead time for just a simple circuit breaker is 8 to 10 weeks!”

As lead times for these power systems grew longer, we realized we already had the capability to manufacture them much faster. This enables us to help our customers keep projects on schedule, while also meeting market demands.

Nick continues: “Other businesses will wait until they have every part of an order, which is bumped to the end of the queue while waiting.” But at Winn-Marion, construction begins as soon as the request is received.

Late payments can create a ripple effect of negative consequences for subcontractors on construction projects, including cash flow struggles and potential legal disputes. As a subcontractor, you need a clear understanding of how late payments can affect construction claims.

The construction sector is steadily growing, yet more than half of subcontractors made less profit because of the rising costs of labor and materials. This makes it even more important for subcontractors to run a tight financial ship, and prevent holes like delays and disputes from eating more into earnings.

Here are some outcomes you want to avoid



Cash flow issues



Late payments from clients can cause subcontractors to struggle with cash flow, resulting in difficulties in meeting financial commitments and potentially jeopardizing their ability to deliver quality work on time. As a consequence, the ripple effect of delayed payments can hinder the smooth operation of the entire "

Continuous thermal monitoring identifies problems in real time

Traditionally, maintenance staff conduct infrared (IR) scans of switchgear during regular maintenance, which can be on an annual or even three-year cycle, depending on environmental conditions and the process itself. When the IR scan indicates an issue, trained staff need to open the switchgear cabinet to investigate.

Digitalization enables a fundamentally different approach, shifting away from in-person IR scans and toward continuous thermal monitoring that provides always-available data. When there’s an issue, an automated alert will inform staff of a problem and when equipment needs servicing. In other words, there’s no need to wait for the annual (or three-year) maintenance scan because you can identify a problem when it’s developing. People do not need to perform time-intensive scans on equipment that does not need to be serviced, which reduces unneeded safety risks and proximity to energized systems. Instead of s"

6 Min. Read

Similar to many current economic issues, the electrician shortage is the result of a mismatch between supply and demand. Over the past 20 years, there have not been enough people entering the industry as experienced electricians are retiring, leading to a shortage in the supply of qualified electrical workers. The timing of which is being exacerbated by the stratospheric demand for electricians to meet the continually growing electricity needs of the nation is greater than ever. This gap will only widen with the proliferation of electrification technologies such as electric vehicle charging, battery storage, load management, panel upgrades, and other renewable energy product integration requirements.

From a big-picture perspective, there are three main forces driving the electrician shortage.

Forty-three out of 50 states are experiencing cement shortages, and drywall is being rationed due to shortages of every required ingredient.

A multitude of factors may prolong these shortages. For example, low river levels are making conditions difficult for shipping, and rising fuel prices combined with a lack of drivers pose challenges for overland transport.

With myriad supply chain interruptions and gaps in material availability, how can the construction industry respond to ensure projects are completed successfully?

The answer lies in minimizing the impact of these shortages where possible. Contractors can’t force the availability of more materials – but a proactive construction manager can find strategies to conserve the materials to hand and maximize the use of inbound shipments.

2023,inflation and electrical equipment procurement,Supply Chain and Inflation: Issues and Impacts,https://www.oracle.com/scm/supply-chain-inflation/,Supply Chain and Inflation: Issues and Impacts,"A sharp rise in demand can strain supply chains, causing supply shortages. Less obvious factors include currency fluctuations, and more acute ones include natural disasters and extreme weather events. Whether logistical or financial, these factors present challenges in obtaining and transporting both raw materials and finished goods—leading to supply shortages that fuel inflation. A shortage of services such as shipping can also fuel inflation within the supply chain.

1. Increased demand for goods and services Increased demand contributes to supply shortages if supply chains can’t produce or transport goods and services fast enough to meet it. For instance, pandemic demand for goods including computers, bikes, kitchen appliances, furniture, and other home improvements taxed global supply chains, which weren’t prepared for the influx of orders. Going forward, businesses are steeling themselves against future demand spikes and supply chain disruptions with better inventory management.

The cost of building the nation’s first small modular reactor (SMR) is rapidly escalating due to the impact of as yet uncontrolled inflation in key commodity areas. According to a set of talking points prepared on January 3, 2023, by the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) there are new details about these costs.

The new cost numbers come in tandem with the completion of NuScale’s Standard Plant Design (SPD) which cover things like facility construction as well as procurement and manufacturing of long-lead time major engineered equipment. Some of these systems and components will come from offshore suppliers.

They come in all shapes and sizes: injuries, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, theft, and inclement weather. While the inconvenience of project delays is immediately transparent, the true impact of construction delays may not be.

Why Construction Delays Count

The unfortunate truth is that 77% of project managers experience delays in their projects–and those projects are delayed by an average of 70 days. The result? Frustrated clients, disrupted project timelines, and increased costs. In fact, construction delays can cost companies millions of extra dollars depending on the size of the project and the length of the delay. Just a 10% project overrun can cost up to 5 million dollars in profitability depending on the size of the project.

The contract usually defines the contractual Mechanical Completion date as the date from which liquidated damages are measured if the contractor does not complete on time. It is also the date from which the contractor will measure its delay damages if actions or inactions of the owner extend its work.

The owner’s definition of the work required to achieve Mechanical Completion is often more inclusive than what the contractor deems necessary. The contractor may attempt to declare that Mechanical Completion has been achieved, and the remaining work is either punch list work or work not necessary to start up the facility. Unless the contract specifies all that is required for Mechanical Completion, delay claims and liquidated damages counterclaims can sour the completion of an otherwise successful project performance by the contractor.

Recently, this ticket has grown much harder to come by. The demand for transformers has spiked worldwide, and so the wait time to get a new transformer has doubled from 50 weeks in 2021 to nearly two years now, according to a report from Wood MacKenzie, an energy-analytics firm. The wait for the more specialized large power transformers (LPTs), which step up voltage from power stations to transmission lines, is up to four years. Costs have also climbed by 60 to 80 percent since 2020.

About five years ago, de Vries grew worried that transformer shortages would postpone his solar projects from coming online, so he b"

Nearly 2,000 MW — almost all solar — has come online in the PJM Interconnection’s footprint this year, down from close to 5,000 MW in 2023, according to a presentation by the grid operator to its Markets and Reliability Committee on Wednesday.

Because of solar’s relatively low “effective load carrying capability” — a measure of its value when the grid is stressed — the solar added this year only represents a few hundred megawatts of capacity, “which is nowhere near where we need to be,” Paul McGlynn, PJM vice president of planning, said during the meeting.

PJM is concerned that proposed projects are clearing the grid operator’s interconnection study process but not getting built, according to McGlynn.

Nearly 450 projects totaling about 37.2 GW in nameplate capacity have signed interconnection agreements but haven’t been built, according to the presentation. Of that total, 8.6 GW is und"

Labor issues, global events and high demand all contribute to shortages. To effectively track and manage materials, contractors need a modern, connected software solution that can provide real-time updates.

High building material costs, continued shortages, and shipping delays continue to affect business operations

Contractors, consumers, and anyone who spends money have high hopes that inflation will continue to abate, and supply chains and prices will stabilize back to normal levels.

While inflation has cooled in recent months, construction material costs have been uneven, and contractors are still plagued with supply-chain problems.



Why are building materials in short supply?



The obvious question is—if the pandemic is no longer at its height, why are building materials still in short supply? The answer is multi-faceted, but the major reasons include the following:

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to impose widespread tariffs when he takes office in January. For commercial builders and their clients, that could spell major price hikes.

While much about the plan remains uncertain, industry leaders are already bracing for its potential impact. The scale of the tariffs — and how rigorously they are enforced — will determine how deeply construction is affected, said Chris Fisher, managing principal at Troy, Michigan-based consulting group Ducker Carlisle.

“What will create challenges for commercial construction is if we see a significant amount of tariffs that are announced, followed through and then actually enforced,” said Fisher. Broad enforcement could disrupt construction by increasing the costs of materials from specific countries, potentially delaying or deferring projects altogether, he said.

In a market framework, prices for products and services are constantly changing. Some prices climb, and some decline. Inflation is defined as a general increase in the prices of goods and services, as opposed to any individual objects. The consumer price index (CPI) serves as a key indicator of inflation. It is measured by the pace at which prices vary across the entire U.S. economy for items such as fruits and vegetables, haircuts, and concert tickets. For instance, as per the U.S. BLS December 2023 estimates, the CPI for food, juices, and drinks increased by 18.6%, motor vehicle repairs rose by 12.7%, and hospitals and related services increased by 6.3%. On the other hand, inflation rates fluctuated a lot in the energy sector due to its high volatility. It is estimated that inflation is still on a bullish momentum.

To help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.

Companies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14

In 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing experti"

Global trade disruptions amid heightened geopolitical tension have impacted the built environment supply chain and costs, and Asia’s construction sector. Notably, only about 8.5% of large projects finish on time and on budget,1 with delays in construction projects in the region exacerbated by material supply shortages, payment delays and defaults, as well as labour shortages and mobility issues.



At the same time, attacks on ships in the Red Sea have extended shipping times for construction materials and heavy equipment — such as machine and engine parts — that are vital to project continuity.2 Factors such as the inflation, economic downturn, armed conflict, social unrest, government policies, and domestic electoral outcomes can also abruptly change the construction landscape, leading to higher costs, project delays and financial impacts.

The adoption of maintenance strategies can help to prevent switchgear failures. This blog examines the causes of switchgear failure and introduces an innovative solution, continuous thermal monitoring, or CTM, that transforms electrical maintenance and provides a solution to switchgear failures.

What is switchgear?

Electrical switchgear refers to a collection of devices used in electrical systems to control, protect, and isolate a power system with multiple controls housed in a metal enclosure. Switchgear is an integral part of power transmission and distribution networks and helps ensure the safe and efficient flow of electricity.
