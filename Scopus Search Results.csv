First, the structural characteristics and construction scheme of the three-phase common enclosure DDS are introduced, and its feasibility to realize the extension and voltage withstand test under non-power outage of 110 kV GIS busbar is demonstrated, and the initial design scheme of three-phase common enclosure DDS is given accordingly. Then, the designed three-phase common enclosure DDS is verified by the calculation of internal insulation, long-term temperature rise and dynamic stability based on the simulation of finite element electric field, temperature flow field and mechanical structure respectively.

2,Donovan T.P.; Morin C.R.; Burns M.,Portland (Maine) International Marine Terminal Western Yard Expansion,2025,Ports 2025: Port Planning and Development - Selected Papers from the 17th Triennial International Conference,"The Portland International Marine Terminal (IMT) is vital to the continued growth of Maine's economy, and the Western Yard Expansion project will increase the ability of the Maine Port Authority (MPA) to serve Maine's import/export needs into the future. The Western Yard Expansion will bring more accessible import/export capabilities to Maine's smaller producers as well as generate income for the state. Further, the expansion will allow the terminal operator, Eimskip, to expand their throughput and to centralize their refrigerated container operations in Portland. The expansion consists of the conversion of the underutilized western yard, currently used to store empty containers and container chassis, into a storage yard for 420 refrigerated containers. The new yard will operate in tandem with a new cold storage warehouse currently under construction adjacent to the site. The design elements associated with the expansion included port planning and internal traffic flow design of the terminal; structural and geotechnical design of the steel refrigerator container racks and the pile-supported concrete foundations; site design and stormwater management; and the electrical design of the primary service, feeder lines, and equipment with an integrated automation system. There were several physical constraints that had to be considered, which proved to be very challenging to the design process. A city-owned combined-sewer-overflow (CSO) pipe and two underground high-voltage transmission lines ran through the site, which required extensive coordination and ultimately led to relocating and upsizing the CSO and including a special foundation to span over the transmission lines. New container stack loads acting on poor marine clays found at the site were expected to result in excessive settlements. Therefore, the refrigerated container rack required a deep foundation (steel pipe piles), and concrete pile caps had to be extended to accommodate each end of the containers. Additionally, the large container live loads required that the concrete foundation beams be designed as deep beams. Finally, the terminal is located across the street from a residential zone, which has noise restrictions during the nighttime hours. An acoustic study performed to evaluate noise from the operating reefer units found that only 15% of the reefer compressors could be running at any given time. Therefore, to control the noise, the electrical switchgear design included an automation system to limit the number of active outlets and in turn, the number of running compressors. This paper focuses on the design challenges and innovative solutions incorporated to allow the development of the western yard expansion to occur, together with the history of the site that has shaped its development over the past two decades and how the Portland IMT fits into the State's Three Port Strategy. © 2025 ASCE."
3,Issabekov D.D.,Resource-Saving Protection of Electrical Installations with Inductive Coils,2025,"Proceedings - 2025 International Russian Smart Industry Conference, SmartIndustryCon 2025","It is worth noting that a key challenge in today's electric power systems relates to the implementation of relay protection for high-voltage electrical installations. This practice has been a topic of discussion at several international conferences on large power systems (CIGRE). It has been suggested that the use of traditional current transformers (CTs) with ferromagnetic cores in such contexts may be a concern. These devices are known for their intensive use of metal, their substantial size, and the cost of their insulation. This article proposes a novel approach to current protection for electrical installations, utilising inductance coils as a means to illustrate the concept. The selection of inductance coils is predicated on their numerous advantages over other magnetosensitive elements in terms of relay protection. However, the feasibility of employing these coils for current protection in various electrical installations has not yet been thoroughly examined. This paper aims to address these concerns in the context of developing current protection for electrical installations using inductance coils fed from complete switchgear (CSG) with voltages ranging from 6 to 10 kV. The proposed protection facilitates the adjustment of settings through remote manipulation of the inductance coil, relative to the plane of the current-carrying busbar, utilising a micromotor. It is hoped that the elimination of costly and metal-intensive current transformers with ferromagnetic cores will contribute to reduced material expenses for the construction of current protection for electrical installations of any type and voltage class. © 2025 IEEE."

Green and environmentally friendly switchgear has become an urgent need for the construction of new power systems. This article establishes an electric-thermal-current multi field coupling simulation model for the accumulation of surface charges on insulators. A method for constructing composite gradient interface insulation of basin insulators is proposed by comparing the surface electric field distribution patterns and surface charge accumulation characteristics of insulators with different structures. The focus of geometric structure optimization is to achieve the reduction of surface normal electric field components and the suppression of surface charge accumulation. Reasonably optimizing the surface contour curve of insulators can simultaneously improve the tangential and normal electric field distribution of insulators, using particle swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. After optimization, the maximum field strength on the convex side of the spacer surface decreased to 3.27 kV/mm, and the maximum field strength on the concave side decreased to 3.67 kV/ mm.  © 2024 IEEE."

In order to further enhance the application range of inflatable cabinets, it is important to optimize the insulation performance of miniaturized switchgear. In this paper, electrostatic field simulation of 40.5kV inflatable switchgear based on the finite element method is carried out to judge the internal electric field distribution. Simulate and analyze the potential distribution and electric field strength distribution under the operating condition of the circuit breaker of the inflatable switchgear. The simulation results show that the electric field of sulfur hexafluoride in the outer shell of the inflatable switchgear is more concentrated near the poles, and the maximum value of the electric field reaches 78.2kV/mm, which exceeds the breakdown strength of the sulfur hexafluoride medium by 9kV/mm. Subsequently, the problem of excessive localized field strength is solved by studying the effects of conditions such as the length of the metal shielding ring and the radius of the metal crimp on the shielding effect. According to the simulation data, maintaining the volume and basic layout of the existing inflatable switchgear cabinet unchanged, after adding the optimized grounded metal shielding ring, the field strength at the pole and shell can be reduced to less than 9kV/mm, which meets the insulation requirements. The research results of this paper can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of the insulation of inflatable switchgear. © 2024 IEEE."
6,Vaghefi-Rezaee H.A.; Khademi-Adel S.; Sarvari H.; Edwards D.J.; Rashidi A.,A hybrid risk-based maintenance approach for evaluating the maintenance risks of urban tunnel lighting systems,2025,Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering,"Purpose: Given the expansion of cities and urbanization, developing efficient and reliable transportation infrastructure, especially urban tunnels, is essential. Failure to maintain such complex construction facilities with intelligent equipment systems could result in human losses and impose huge costs on governments. Therefore, it is necessary to have practical maintenance plans and operational safety monitoring for urban tunnels, which leads to their long lifespan, increases users’ safety and reduces operation risks. Design/methodology/approach: Hence, this research aims to evaluate the maintenance risks of urban tunnel lighting systems (UTLS) using a hybrid risk-based maintenance (RBM) approach. In this vein, three rounds of a fuzzy Delphi survey were conducted to consolidate the specific operation criteria and maintenance risk factors to the circumstances of Iran and UTLS. Furthermore, the fuzzy DEMATEL method was applied to determine the cause-and-effect relationships among the identified critical operation criteria. The identified risks associated with maintenance in UTLS were then analyzed and ranked using a combination of fuzzy ANP-VIKOR techniques. Findings: The ranking of the various risks revealed that the “poor performance of switchboards in power supply due to faults in switchboard equipment” risk was ranked first, followed by the “poor performance of panels in the power supply due to unfavorable environmental conditions,” “The poor performance of panels in the power supply due to problems with switches (key failure)” and “The poor performance of panels in power supply due to burning fuses due to unauthorized current” risks. The findings of this study indicate that this hybrid maintenance method, developed as a risk-based network, provides reliability for maintaining urban tunnel lighting systems (UTLS). Originality/value: It is anticipated that the findings of this research will considerably contribute to improving UTLS maintenance management while enhancing different stakeholders’ understanding of the most critical risks in maintenance, particularly toward the UTLS in Iran. An RBM management program can result in preparing and formulating policies, comprehensive guidelines or regulations for the maintenance of urban tunnels that are recommended for future research. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

These concerns relate to potential environmental and electrical safety impacts. This study assesses and compares electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure levels, including electric field (EF) and magnetic field (MF), from three 115/22 kV substations in urban areas: air-insulated switchgear, gas-insulated switchgear, and mixed-technology switchgear. The environmental impact assessment considers air quality, noise, and heat. EMF field measurements are compared with ICNIRP Guidelines to evaluate general public and occupational exposure levels. The correlation between the exposure levels from each substation and their daily load curves is examined. Results show that EMF exposure levels are within acceptable limits, ensuring the safety of the general public and substation personnel. Additionally, measurements for particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10), 24-h-averaged-noise level (Leq24h), and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) indicate that the environmental impact is within the relevant Thai standards. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Alternating-current voltage controllers are implemented that are based on a transformer with a partitioned secondary winding and a semiconductor switchboard constructed on the basis of on controlled switches. When analyzing processes in an RPC, the ac voltage controller can be represented as a transformer with an adjustable transformation coefficient. Electromagnetic processes in an RPC are considered when its power is adjusted within a wide range via control of the transformation coefficient of the transformer. Analytical relationships defining the currents, voltages, and installed power values that characterize RPC power-circuit elements are presented. The fact that the requirements for the parameters of the power switches of a semiconductor switchboard depend on the network voltage is noted. Circuitry solutions are given for RPC design that make the requirements for the parameters of power switches depending on the voltage of the supply network less stringent. Examples of calculating the parameters of 10- and 35-kV RPCs that provide reactive-power adjustment in the range from 0 to 5 MVAR are presented. The simulation results for operating modes of RPCs made on the basis of the proposed circuitry solutions, as well as the results of studies on an RPC prototype providing the adjustment of reactive power in the range from 0 to 5 MVAR when operating powered by a 10-kV network, are compared.

Under the development of the green economy, the requirements for energy conservation and carbon reduction have improved; hence, an assessment of carbon emissions in transformer substations is urgently needed. A calculation method was proposed in the present study to analyze the carbon emissions of transformer substations with different kinds of data sources, which were collected from several practical projects in the west-to-east power transmission project. In this study, a detailed comparison and discussion regarding the differences in carbon emissions of 750 kV transformer substations caused by hydrology, geology, engineering quantity, and other factors were conducted. The mean value, standard deviation, and 90% confidence interval of carbon emissions were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation through MATLAB. Results show that the total carbon emissions of the selected 750 kV transformer substations are between [56,000, 68,000] t CO2 eq. Construction engineering accounts for more than 50% of carbon emissions, followed by installation engineering and additional services. In terms of input items, electricity distribution buildings contribute more than 39% of total carbon emissions, followed by cable/earthing systems, which account for 14% of total carbon emissions. Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and air insulated switchgear (AIS) could adopt different types of equipment foundations, and GIS equipment foundations would generate fewer carbon emissions due to the smaller land area and input materials. This study can provide experience and reference for similar projects and further guide the substation carbon emission reduction work. © 2023 by the authors."

12,Pei S.; Sun H.; Sun Z.; Hu C.; Zhu Y.,High-Precision Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds for Primary Equipment in Substations Based on DI-PointNet; [基于 DI-PointNet 的变电站主设备点云高精度语义分割方法],2025,Diangong Jishu Xuebao/Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society,"In substation robot inspection tasks, high-precision semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data is one of the key technologies. Traditional point cloud semantic segmentation algorithms have certain limitations, making it difficult to handle complex 3D scenes. Deep learning methods have compensated for the shortcomings of traditional point cloud semantic segmentation algorithms and have become the main method for achieving point cloud semantic segmentation. However, existing point cloud segmentation methods for substations face issues such as high complexity, low accuracy, and gradient vanishing. To address these issues and achieve accurate segmentation of the main equipment point cloud in substations, this paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method for substation main equipment point clouds based on DI-PointNet. Firstly, on the basis of the PointNet++ network structure, a double-layer consecutive transformer (DLCTransformer) module is introduced. Key points are sampled through the DLCTransformer to enhance information interaction between point clouds and expand the effective receptive field. Secondly, a hierarchical key sampling strategy is adopted. The point cloud data is divided into the original dense point cloud space and a sparse point cloud space formed after farthest point sampling. These are then divided into multiple non-overlapping 3D windows, ultimately generating key values required for self-attention mechanism calculations, thereby reducing computational complexity, improving the model’s receptive field, and aggregating long-range context to achieve information interaction of substation-associated point clouds. Finally, an inverted residual module (InvResMLP) based on residual connections and inverted bottleneck design is added to the network. This enhances the model’s ability to extract complex structural features from substation point clouds while effectively reducing the gradient vanishing problem, making the algorithm more robust in handling complex substation scenarios and improving the accuracy of semantic segmentation of substation main equipment point clouds. Additionally, to validate the segmentation effectiveness of the algorithm, this paper uses Avia LiDAR equipment to collect point cloud images of different devices at substations such as the Baobei substation in Baoding City. The original data includes transformers, switchgear, steel towers, insulators, maintenance equipment, and others (mainly vegetation and buildings). To simplify the point cloud data while filtering noise, the original input point cloud is first subjected to grid sampling with a grid size of 0.03 m. Data augmentation methods such as z-axis rotation, scaling, perturbation, and color reduction are employed. The initial window size is set to 0.12 m and is doubled after each down-sampling layer. The DI-PointNet is trained using the cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer with the following hyperparameters: initial learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 2, and 100 epochs. To ensure the reasonableness and accuracy of the experiments, the comparative algorithms used in this paper are trained using the same hardware platform, environment version, loss function, optimizer, hyperparameters, and training strategies as DI-PointNet. Through ablation experiments and comparative analysis, the DI-PointNet algorithm proposed in this paper improves the overall accuracy (OA) value of substation point cloud segmentation by 3.4 percentage points compared to before the improvement, while reducing algorithm complexity. The proposed algorithm outperforms other mainstream deep learning algorithms and other point cloud segmentation algorithms in the power sector. The performance of this algorithm is close to the accuracy of manual segmentation and can achieve precise segmentation of substation point clouds. © 2025 China Machine Press. All rights reserved."

Initially, the insulators are subjected to accelerated thermal aging tests at 220 degrees Celsius in a high-temperature oven for various durations. Subsequently, the aged insulators are analyzed through mass loss testing and partial discharge testing, which provide metrics correlating to different levels of discoloration and aging. Using image processing techniques, the RGB values of each image are extracted as indicators of discoloration, establishing a relationship between the color change characteristics of epoxy resin insulators and their aging status.

In the daily operation and maintenance of the substation and loss statistics, for some switchgears in the area of direct conductive equipment, there is an abnormal local overheating phenomenon. The main reason for this phenomenon is the eddy current loss in the substation, which seriously affects the safe operation of substation equipment due to the heating defect. This paper analyzes the local overheating problem in substation switchgear and proposes the distribution of eddy current loss and its influencing factors of optimization strategy from the aspect of loss source design. Based on the Maxwell equation, the loss calculation model is established. The optimization method of eddy current loss is comprehensively evaluated according to the distribution characteristics of eddy current loss. The temperature of the bushing surface under different voltage levels is measured, and the error between the calculated results and the measured results is within 2%. Therefore, within the allowable error range, the simulation results and the formula calculation results can fit the measured values well, which verifies the correctness of the established wall bushing heating simulation model and temperature calculation formula.

Therefore, in accordance with the difficulty in detecting micron-nano dust and the complexity of the mechanism, a micron-nano dust adsorption experimental platform suitable for observation and suitable for the actual operation of GIS is constructed, and it is found that the adsorption state of micron-nano dust in the electric field mainly consists of agglomerative adsorption along the insulator interface and diffusive adsorption along the direction of the ground electrode, and the key factors influencing the behavior of the movement include the initial position of the micron-nano dust, the quality, the material, and the applied voltage; it is further clarified that micron-nano dust may be the hidden safety killer behind. The special physical phenomena in the adsorption process are further clarified. Agglomerative adsorption will occur on the surface of the epoxy resin insulator to form a micron-nano dust speckle, meanwhile, with the increase of voltage, the micro-nano dust speckle will “explode” to form an annular dust halo, and the contour of the halo will be deepened, etc., which is different from that of the starting adsorption, and such special physical phenomena are considered to induce the flashover along the face of the insulator. This kind of special physical phenomenon is a necessary condition for inducing flashover along the surface. Finally, the physical mechanism of flashover along the surface triggered by micron-nano dust is revealed, and the localized short-circuit area and violent electric field distortion constituted by dust speckle are the important predisposing factors of micron-nano dust induced flashover along the surface, reducing the breakdown voltage up to 71%.

Electricity systems need to be low-carbon, and the carbon emission of the substation is worth studying. This paper presents the calculation method of carbon emission in a substation’s full lifecycle, including equipment manufacturing and materials, construction and equipment installation, operation and maintenance, and demolition and disposal. A certain substation’s carbon emissions are calculated at each stage in detail. The result shows that the carbon emissions are mainly from the operation and maintenance stage, and the principal source of carbon emissions is electrical equipment and the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) equipment.

This is motivating the adoption of Direct Current power distribution systems. The voltage range is from 1 kV to 12 kV or greater (LVDC to MVDC), and the steady state current range is up to 5 kA. DC circuit breakers operate faster than AC breakers since they circumvent the current zero-crossing requirement of AC breakers. Protective DC switchgear is a key element in a DC power distribution system that provides electric power reliably and cost-effectively, utilizing more efficient, high-power sources, energy storage, and transmission. For over 25 years, Diversified Technologies Inc (DTI) has been designing and building high-voltage DC circuit breakers capable of multi-kA switching at voltages up to and greater than 100 kV.

However, there remain numerous challenges in intelligently devising maintenance plans for switchgear based on diverse detection data. Therefore, the construction of a lifecycle prediction model for insulation defects in switchgear is of significant theoretical and practical value for exploring the development trends of insulation defects, achieving status-based maintenance of switchgear insulation, and ensuring the safe operation of switchgear. This paper designs a lifecycle prediction model for switchgear defects based on a multi-parameter MKL model, including the processes of multi-parameter data feature extraction, data feature fusion, and defect lifecycle prediction. Firstly, aggregate features are extracted from the multi-parameter data of switchgear equipment. Subsequently, the kernel weights of various perspectives are obtained based on the MKL optimization algorithm. Finally, the SVM algorithm is employed to project the multi-perspective kernel weights into the target space, thereby obtaining the lifecycle prediction model for switchgear insulation defects.

In the process of building modern transformer substation in China, Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) has been widely used. The faults caused by poor contact in GIS account for 29% of all faults, making it the highest occurrence rate among all faults. Poor contact leads to abnormal temperature rise of the contacts, so it is necessary to conduct research of temperature rise.

Surface flashover across the spacer/gas interface threats the running of GIS/GIL. Hence, it is urgent to enhance the surface insulation strength of spacer especially in the situations where compact design and/or the usage of eco-friendly gases are required. Numerous studies revealed that locally intensified electric (E) field caused by dielectric mismatch or metal particles mainly accounts for the insulation failure of spacer. To design and fabricate a downsized 550 kV spacer in GIS that takes both the structure optimization and dielectric distribution optimization into account, a fabrication method that considering E field mitigation effectiveness and the fabrication efficiency was proposed. Firstly, 1:10 downsized dielectrically graded 550 kV spacers were fabricated by combining stereolithography 3D printing technology with epoxy resin casting technique. Specifically, alumina/UV-cured resin composite was prepared as a low relative permittivity (3.98＜εr＜4.20) 3D printed slurry to fabricate the main parts of insulators. The characterizations of composites’ photocuring and rheological behaviors indicated that the doping of alumina fillers decreases the photo-curing depth and increase the viscosity particularly in high fillers’ loading content. The processing performance of composite deteriorated when loading content exceeds 30%, since the viscosity pronouncedly increases. After determining fillers’ loading content and printing parameters, the main part of spacers with low permittivity was fabricated by stereolithography 3D printing. Characterization of its dielectric properties confirmed the correctness of permittivity range. Subsequently, titania/epoxy resin composite was prepared as high relative permittivity (11.32＜εr＜14.58) vacuum casted slurry. To guarantee good match at interface, composite with 30% titania loading content was selected. The characterizations of composites’ rheological behaviors indicated that the viscosity of composite dramatically decreases with the increase of temperature, benefiting the flowing of slurry in the reserved high permittivity region in the 3D printed spacer. After determining the curing conditions, the slurry was heated and then cured to finish the downsized spacer manufacturing. Secondly, flashover tests of spacers before and after optimization ware carried out in compressed SF6 gas. Characterizations of power frequency withstand voltage indicated that insulation structures after optimization exhibit improved electrical performance. Comparing with an original insulation structure, geometrically optimized spacer shows a 13.6% flashover voltage improvement, and this improvement increase to 13.8% for geometrically/dielectrically optimized spacer. After reducing a 15% of insulation distance, geometrically/ dielectrically optimized spacer shares the same insulation level with the original structure. When a metal wire existing in the wedgy airgap at the flange side, improved electrical strength of the geometrically optimized spacer at the same insulation distance reduces to 6.7%. In contrast, owing to the low electric field area forming by the spacer with further optimized dielectric distribution, a 13.1% flashover voltage improvement still could be maintained, indicating the insulation excellence of the geometrically/dielectrically optimized spacer. The proposed spacer construction strategy takes both optimization effectiveness and fabrication efficiency into account, and the fabricated dielectrically graded 550 kV spacers exhibit excellent surface electrical insulation properties, offering the possibility of reducing size of GIS tank, and is considered as an essential step towards the industrial application of 3D printed spacer in GIS/GIL. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press.

Switchgear circuits are chosen depending on the number of supply and transit lines and transformers, the substation’s place in the power supply system, and the area that can be allocated under the substation construction.

Considering that GIS may be affected by various vibration factors in actual operation, this paper builds an intermittent discharge test platform for shock and vibration superimposed multi-source detection, and carries out experimental research on the characteristics of intermittent discharge under different vibration conditions for common internal typical insulation defects in GIS. The study found: The vibration state has a certain influence on the intermittent discharge of defects in GIS equipment, and the intermittent discharge law in the non-vibration state is consistent with that in the normal operation vibration. However, the insulation strength of metal particle defects decreases greatly under shock vibration, and with the continuous discharge process, the discharge interval develops from seconds to milliseconds, from intermittent discharge to continuous discharge.

In this paper, the structure features and construction scheme of the new DDS are introduced. The finite element simulations of the electric fields inside the DDS chamber were also performed. Based on the construction scheme of the 110 kV three-phase enclosed DDS, it can be seen that the main busbar does not need to be de-energized during the second stage expansion and voltage withstand tests, which makes in-service expansions of the 110 kV substations possible. By the electric field distribution simulations, the electric fields of the conductors of the new three-phase enclosed DDS are all below 22 kV/mm, and lower than the allowable electric field.

55,Sui G.; Yan J.; Qi M.; Chen P.,GIS Insulation Fault Diagnosis Based on GraphSAGE,2024,ICEPE-ST 2024 - 7th International Conference on Electric Power Equipment - Switching Technology,"Deep learning has been widely used in insulation fault diagnosis of GIS. Common deep learning methods include convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural network (GCN). CNN relies on a large amount of data as a training set. Although GCN solves the problem of data dependence, it is transductive learning and cannot be generalized to unseen nodes, which makes the performance of GCN unsatisfactory in the practical application of GIS insulation fault diagnosis. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a GIS insulation fault diagnosis method based on graph Sampling and Aggregation algorithms (graphSAGE). First, the GIS voltage signal is converted into a graph structure using the Adaptive K-nearest neighbors graph construction method (AKNN), and then the graph structure is input into the graphSAGE network. On the one hand, the graphSAGE network can determine the number and number of layers of sampled neighbors, making the model more expressive. On the other hand, graphSAGE is inductive learning, which enables it to learn a set of aggregation functions to process unseen nodes, making a big step forward in the practical application of graph neural network in GIS insulation fault diagnosis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments, and the results show that the accuracy of this method is significantly higher than that of traditional deep learning networks. © 2024 IEEE."

It is of great significance to realize the health management of electromagnetic circuit breakers to improve the reliability, security, and stability of power supply systems. With the development of advanced sensor technology, industrial big data technology, and artificial intelligence technology, the “data-driven approach” has gradually replaced the previous “mechanism modeling approach” to become the mainstream research direction of electromagnetic circuit breaker health management technology. Condition monitoring and intelligent assessment are the main contents in this field. Through a detailed review of the main references or published technology patents in the past decade, the current research status of “sensing monitoring”, “feature extraction and dimension reduction”, “fault diagnosis”, “health assessment”, and “residual life prediction” were analyzed. For “sensing monitoring”, almost all sensing signals and their monitoring methods were covered from electrical, mechanical, and temperature characteristics. The advantages and disadvantages of each sensing signal were expounded, respectively. It is pointed out that the sensitivity of various signals to the deterioration of different parts of the circuit breaker is different. It is difficult to reflect the overall deterioration state of the circuit breaker by relying only on a single type of signal, so it may be necessary to monitor multi-source sensing signals for fusion analysis. For “feature extraction and dimension reduction”, typical feature extraction methods, such as the short-time energy method, wavelet transform, and empirical mode decomposition, were mainly analyzed from the time domain and time-frequency domain mixture two aspects. Furthermore, two types of feature dimension reduction methods were summarized; For “fault diagnosis”, building expert systems and applying machine learning are the mainstream research in this field. The existing typical algorithms were summarized, and it is pointed out that the above two kinds of methods need rich expert experience and comprehensive data sources, respectively, to achieve better diagnosis results. For “health assessment”, the existing methods were summarized into two categories: level assessment and quantitative assessment. It is pointed out that there are few related studies in this field, and further research is needed. For “residual life prediction”, the existing methods of “direct mapping based mapping model” and “indirect prediction based deterioration model” were introduced and summarized respectively, and their shortcomings were discussed. In addition, the hardware implementation schemes of condition monitoring and intelligent assessment techniques in existing research were briefly summarized. Finally, considering the existing problems, the following research methods and development trends of scientific and technological problems are discussed. (1) Combined with the working conditions of circuit breakers and the Internet of things technology, developing a special sensor monitoring method and constructing a distributed multi-source sensor network with high reliability and low cost will become the mainstream way. (2) Digital twin technology, multi-physical field coupling simulation technology, and virtual simulation technology combined will become a major trend to explore the deterioration law under the comprehensive influence in multiple ways. (3) Multi-disciplinary integration can enhance the completeness of intelligent assessment methods. (4) The application of cloud computing, 5G, and other new technologies should be accelerated. The embedded integration, real-time control, distributed control, and system security should be comprehensively considered as far as possible to jointly promote the practical process of electromagnetic circuit breaker health management system platform. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press.

This study examines the mechanical properties —including flexural and compressive strengths— of various ternary matrices, known as limestone calcined clay cement (LC3), developed with residue fillers and metakaolin. Subsequently, laminated textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) panels were fabricated using 100% Portland cement (PC) and an optimized LC3 matrix (containing ≤ 50% PC). These TRM panels, structured as sandwich-like laminates, were reinforced with nonwoven fabrics made from textile waste (TW) fibers sourced from garment industries. Results revealed that the mechanical properties of LC3 matrices were comparable to conventional PC, achieving flexural and compressive strengths exceeding 10 MPa and 120 MPa (at 28 days), respectively. Both LC3 and PC-based TRM plates demonstrated flexural-hardening behavior, achieving flexural strength of greater 10.0 MPa and energy absorption above 5.0 kJ/m2 (at 7 days). The study highlights that reducing PC content to ≤ 50%, replacing limestone powder with filler wastes, and utilizing recycled fibers as reinforcement can meet the performance requirements of cement panel boards for limited structural applications, contributing significantly to sustainable construction practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."

In modern society, the use of electrical appliances is an essential element for a comfortable life. However, in many classrooms or dorms, students may waste energy by leaving lighting and air conditioning systems on even when not in use and an optimized distribution of the used sensors is required for the resource-efficient (indoor) location of mobile humans. Indoor positioning, or the location of beacons or sensors inside buildings, may be a challenging and time-consuming process, particularly when done by hand. This topic has already been attempted to be solved by a number of researchers under various use cases and using various approaches. Nevertheless, none of the approaches that are now available use Boolean variables alone to do constraint programming. To address this issue, we are creating a smart IoT system that saves energy by turning on lights and fans when motion is detected in a specific part of a room. To be more precise, we want to optimize the beacons for an indoor locating system that uses trilateration. According to this method, three beacons have to be within range of each potential location inside the structure. The initially determined beacon placements are then further optimized in a subsequent stage. In order to do this, fewer beacons are used. Next, we assess the beacon placements’ quality by comparing them to a manually optimized beacon placement and assessing the quality of many sample places in an existing building. This system uses a PIR sensor for motion detection which makes it cost efficient. The electrical switch is controlled by a5V-1 channel relay connected to an Arduino board in the switchboard. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."
60,Wang Q.; Chu J.; Li Q.; Yang A.; Yuan H.; Rong M.; Wang X.,Miniature Gas-Sensing Array Employed for the Discharge Fault Diagnosis of Air-Insulated Equipment; [基于微型气体传感阵列的空气绝缘设备放电故障识别],2023,Diangong Jishu Xuebao/Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society,"As a natural insulating gas, air is widely used in power equipment (switchgear, ring cabinets, etc.). It will produce characteristic decomposition products represented by NO2 when the power equipment occurs internal faults. The content of composition reflects the severity of the discharge fault. Therefore, the detection of gas decomposition products is helpful to the stable operation of power equipment. The cross-sensitivity of the sensor materials towards NO2 and CO have seriously restricted the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To address these issues, this paper develops a miniature gas-sensing array with high sensitivity and great reliability, which aimed for the discharge fault diagnosis of air-insulated equipment. This paper has simulated 15 air discharge faults including corona discharge, spark discharge, and arc discharge at different voltage levels and durations. After that, Fourier infrared tests were performed on the 15 gas samples. However, there has no apparent absorption peak of CO and O3 in the infrared absorption spectrum. The absorption peak in 1 650～1 550 cm-1 band corresponds to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of O＝N＝O chemical bond. This indicates the presence of NO2 in the decomposition products of air. Besides, discharge with different voltages and times shows significant differences in the content of NO2. To discriminate fault characteristic gases, this paper has integrated a micro sensor array loaded with four gas-sensitive nanomaterials (10%WO3-10%SnCl2-In2O3, 5%NiO-10%SnCl2-In2O3, 10%TiO2-10%SnCl2-In2O3 and 5%SnO2-10%SnCl2-In2O3). Then the paper obtains the repeatable gas response recovery curves under different discharge faults, which lays the foundation for the construction of gas identification model. The results demonstrate that the higher voltage and the longer discharge time means the larger response value of sensor array. Accordingly, it is further proved that the higher air-discharge voltages and times generates more characteristic decomposition gas. In addition, t-SNE dimensionality reduction has been employed to explore the identification ability of miniature gas-sensing array. The identification results of different air discharge faults are 84.88%, 81.82%, 76.86%, and 81.32% by four machine learning algorithms (Extra Tree, Decision Tree, KNN, and RF) respectively. And the recognition ability of the micro gas sensing array for partial discharge and arc discharge is slightly higher than that of spark discharge. The essential reason can be ascribed to the saturation of NO2 in the process of multiple spark discharges. The following conclusions can be drawn from the simulation analysis: (1) The FTIR of air discharge products shows that the arc discharge (200～400 μL/L) produces more NO2 than corona and spark discharge (10～50 μL/L). Besides, the NO2 concentration increases with the increase of discharge voltage and discharge time (times). (2) Compared with corona and spark discharge, the response value of the micro sensor array towards arc discharge products (6 kV, 4 033%) is nearly 3 times higher than that of spark discharge (15 kV, 5 times, 1 142.8%). (3) After the feature reduction of 10-dimensional PCA, we compared four machine learning algorithms, and found that the Extra Tree algorithm obtained the best identification accuracy of air discharge fault (84.88%). © 2023 Chinese Machine Press.

The primary sources of carbon emissions are electrical loss and the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) equipment.

Partial discharge (PD) monitoring is well established for existing SF6 equipment, but still in its infancy for the emerging SF6 alternatives as the power industry transitions from SF6. PD characteristics of 20% C3F7CN / 80% CO2 gas mixture as a viable retrofill solution were extensively investigated over extended energization periods in a busbar demonstrator designed for SF6 and rated to 420/550 kV. Protrusions of 3, 5, 10 and 15 mm needle lengths were used on the high voltage conductor for comparative PD investigations of SF6 and 20% C3F7CN / 80% CO2 gas mixture. PD activity was measured with IEC 60270 (apparent charge) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) detection methods. The PD patterns recorded for all needle lengths were representative of a protrusion-on-conductor defect and the two PD detection methods were comparable. For identical defect lengths, SF6 showed a comparatively longer time-to-breakdown when compared to a 20% C3F7CN / 80% CO2 mixture. Results obtained in a controlled laboratory environment demonstrate wider applicability to field measurements of C3F7CN based mixtures adopted for retrofill application in SF6-designed gas insulated busbar. © 1986-2012 IEEE."

On the other hand, medium-voltage (MV) solid-insulated switchgears have been applied since the late 1960s and signi cant compactness is achieved by integrally molding live parts of the switchgear with solid insulation materials such as epoxy resin, which has a much higher insulation strength than SF6 gas. This paper describes the excellent operational performance over a period of more than 50 years, outstanding safety, maintenance and inspection ef ciency, and long-term reliability of environmentally friendly solid-insulated switchgear (SIS) that does not use SF6 gas. SIS is suitable for installation in buildings and underground spaces due to its small size. Approximately 6 000 units of SIS have been installed especially in narrow spaces such as buildings and underground areas around large cities for utilities, general industries, and transportation facilities. For approximately 3 000 units which have been delivered to utilities, The rate of major failures leading to supply outage over a 50-year period is less than half that of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), demonstrating the high reliability of SIS. Recent evaluations of SIS operated for approximately 10 to 50 years old in the eld were also conducted. They were shipped back to the factory from the eld for investigation such as vacuum deterioration of vacuum interrupter and insulation lifetime. As a result, the expected lifetime was evaluated to be approximately 60 years. Furthermore, life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluation results show that the SIS can reduce the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2 equivalent to about 65-70% of that of a cubicle-type gas-insulated switchgear (C-GIS). SIS does not use uorinated gases or any other high 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) gasses, it has been proven to have a similar or better expected lifetime and reliability compared to GIS, and it has less GHG emissions in CO2 equivalent, in addition to the advantage of compactness. Therefore, SIS can be considered one of the solutions for switchgears without SF gases whose applications are expected to be expanded in the future. 6. © 2024-CIGRE."

Due to factors such as cost, the number of ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors employed on site is often limited, resulting in detection blind spots. The PD sensing technology based on the internal shield ring of basin insulators can effectively solve the problem of insufficient detection points. In this paper, a 1000-kV GIS test platform is established, the frequency response characteristics, pulse response characteristics, and sensing directionality of insulator PD sensor and traditional inner UHF sensor are studied and compared. The results show that, within 300 MHz~1500 MHz, the return loss of the insulator sensor is higher than that of the inner UHF sensor, while the insertion loss is lower than that of the inner sensor. The insulator sensor has better signal sensing characteristics in the frequency range of 300 MHz to 1500 MHz. The detection sensitivity of the inner sensor will be significantly affected by the installation angle of the sensor, while the insulator sensor has weak sensing directionality in GIS PD detection, which is conducive to practical application.

Power transformer as the core equipment of the power grid, its operational reliability is related to the safety of the entire power grid, therefore, the development of digital twin transformer is of great significance to support the intelligent, digital, visualized operation and maintenance of high-end power equipment. However, there are still significant challenges for transformers due to the lack of corresponding digital twin capabilities, such as insufficient sensors, unknown parametric mechanism, and lack of post-processing techniques. For this reason, this paper carries out a research on a state twinning method for transformer internal insulation by virtual-real fusion. Firstly, the internal temperature field distribution of the transformer is the data basis for calculating the state parameter distribution. Considering the complex multi-physical field coupling effect of the transformer, the calculated losses are used as the heat source of the temperature field simulation for the multi-physical field coupling calculation, and the temperature field distribution corresponding to the real-time load change is derived based on the load rate monitored in the field. Secondly, the temperature field distribution of virtual calculation and the moisture in oil data of physical monitoring are combined to analyze the distribution law of moisture in paper at each local location inside the transformer. Based on the relationship between the total moisture content in the paper of multiple transformers in the field and the operation time, an empirical formula is established, and the oil-paper equilibrium equation and the law of moisture diffusion are utilized to determine the content and distribution. Thirdly, considering the effect of moisture distribution on the moisture translational factor, a dynamic derivation model of degree of polymerization distribution based on the joint action of time-temperature-moisture distribution is established, and the results of the degree of polymerization distribution of the insulating cardboard inside the transformer are obtained. Finally, due to the fact that the multi-physics field simulation calculation results and the dynamic deduction numerical results are discrete point data, this paper adopts the point-by-point insertion method of Delaunay triangular mesh for the continuity of the discrete data, and the state parameter data obtained by virtual-realistic fusion calculation are visualized in this paper. The results show that the moisture distribution calculated by virtual-real fusion is mainly concentrated in the laminated cardboard on both sides and the bottom of the solid insulation, with the highest moisture content of about 3.2% in the 48th year, which is greatly influenced by the temperature field distribution and environmental factors. The rule of the degree of polymerization distribution in the windings is in general agreement with the measurements reported by CIGRE, and the lowest value is located in the hot spot temperature region of the low-voltage windings, with a value of 252.15 in the 48th year, which verifies the validity and reasonableness of the methodology.

The complex mechanism of moisture condensation makes it difficult to accurately model and predict the critical condensation temperature, especially with limited data samples. Addressing the challenge of building a prediction method that does not rely on precise models in data-scarce situations is an urgent need. This paper proposes a method for predicting the critical condensation temperature of high-voltage switchgear based on TimeGAN-augmented data, aiming to improve prediction accuracy. First, to address the issue of data scarcity, TimeGAN is employed to augment the training samples. Then, a Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) is used to iteratively optimize the hyperparameters of a BiLSTM model, constructing the IGWO-BiLSTM model to predict the critical condensation temperature. Finally, simulation validation is performed using real-world data from a 35kV high-voltage switchgear in Fujian, China.

Modelling DA labels at the utterance-level requires contextual and speaker-aware understanding, especially for conversational agents handling Japanese dialogues. In this study, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-based Multi-dimensional Edge Graph Neural Network (HAM-GNN) to effectively model DA labels by capturing speaker interconnections and contextual semantics. Specifically, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) first encode contextual information within a dialogue window. We then construct a context graph by aggregating neighbouring utterances and apply a graph attention network (GAT) to model speaker interactions with multi-dimensional edges. To prevent incorrect edge definitions from completely deactivating connections during training, we initialize soft edges for nominally unconnected nodes with a small non-zero value. Moreover, to avoid loss of contextual information from localized graph construction, we utilize a convolutional Transformer (Conformer) to build residual connections. Subsequently, a gated graph convolutional network (GatedGCN) selects salient utterances for DA classification. Finally, multi-level representations are merged and fed to dense layers for classification. We evaluate our HAM-GNN model on the Japanese DA dataset (JPS-DA) and the English Switchboard DA dataset (SWDA). Results show our method outperforms baselines on JPS-DA and achieves competitive performance on SWDA. The graph-based architecture effectively encodes utterance semantics and speaker relationships for DA prediction in conversational systems. © 2024"

The sensor comprises a combination of magnetic and electric couplers, effectively segregating forward and backward pulses to enhance PD charge estimation and defect location. The sensor's design was supported with finite element method simulations and measurements conducted in a transverse electromagnetic test bench. Comparative analyses were performed against independent magnetic and electric couplers. The charge estimation and the directional coupler's directivity were evaluated in both the test bench and a full-scale GIS with different PD defects. Initially, the combined magnetic and the electric couplers exhibited undesired interactions, prompting corrective measures. Subsequent adjustments included changes to the electric coupler material and modifications to the magnetic coupler construction.

The two significant sources of these faults are the accumulation of charge on the insulator surface and the adsorption of metal particles or dust. We focus on the charge transport relationship at the gas-solid interface, revise the continuity equation for ion density in the insulating gas, and analyze the importance of electric field control. Furthemore, we summarize the research findings of scholars both domestically and internationally who have used technical means such as structural optimization of insulators, modification of bulk materials, and modification of surface materials to control interface charge, optimization of the surface electric field, and suppressions of dust adsorption. Additionally, we outline the key issues and significant technical challenges that remain to be addressed.

These transformer substations are widely used to step down medium voltage to low voltage and supply end-customers.The focus of the considerations is the pressure load caused on the inside of the electrical distribution substation building. For existing buildings made of masonry, hardly any literature is available taking the dynamic of the pressure load into account. However, available limit values for static pressure load might be exceeded. Due to the lack of accurate assessment methods for arc pressure loading by structural engineers, conservative approaches must be used. The costly consequence is that either great efforts must be made to limit the pressure or the distribution substation hast to be rebuilt.

Bio-filler reinforced polymer composites, particularly our Date seed and Acacia filler reinforced vinyl ester (DSF/AF-VE), provide multifaceted advantages like ecological sustainability, cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, reduced carbon footprint, and enhanced processability for diverse applications, including automotive components, biodegradable packaging, and lightweight construction materials. This study explores using Date seed and Acacia fillers, known for their sustainability, recyclability, and biodegradability, in polymer composites. By incorporating these fillers with vinyl ester, we aimed to enhance properties like mechanical strength, thermal stability, and wear resistance. A standard compression molding process was chosen for this experiment due to its proven effectiveness in achieving uniform filler distribution, reproducibility of composite properties, and its suitability for large-scale industrial applications. DSF/AF-VE composites were produced with filler loadings ranging from 10% to 40%, maintaining a 50% filler/ filler ratio. Our findings indicate that an optimal filler proportion significantly enhances the structural properties of the composite. A filler concentration of 15w% yielded the best tensile and flexural strength, while 20w% was optimal for impact strength. The DSF/ AF-VE hybrid filler showed considerable improvements in tensile, flexural, and impact strength compared to the clear matrix, with increases of 1.53 times, 1.48 times, and 1.93 times, respectively. This study underscores the potential of Date seed and Acacia fillers in enhancing the mechanical properties of natural polymer composites, suggesting their suitability for low-load applications, such as switchboards, panels, wheel arches, and air spoilers. © 2024World Scientific Publishing Co."

This paper puts forward the research of flexible UHF sensing technology, combines the antenna body with the flexible material, and reduces the volume of the built-in rear antenna on the premise of ensuring the performance of the antenna to meet the requirements, so as to simplify the complex built-in process and the problem of damaging the electric field distribution. In this paper, a flexible UHF spiral antenna sensor is designed. The antenna body is miniaturized by means of sine wave loading and increasing the gap ratio of the antenna body. At the same time, Balun is co-planar with the antenna body, greatly reducing the overall volume of the antenna. The PD detection performance of the antenna was measured by building a GIS typical defect partial discharge simulation experiment platform. The results show that the flexible antenna can effectively detect PD signals under different bending degrees and has a high signal-to-noise ratio. Firstly, the common Archimedes spiral antenna was combined with the flexible material PI to build the antenna simulation model, and the performance simulation of the unbent antenna and the antenna with different bending degrees was carried out. Through the simulation of antenna voltage standing wave ratio and direction diagram, it can be seen that antenna body bending has little influence on antenna performance. Then, the common Archimedes spiral antenna is loaded in the form of sine wave. In this way, the size of the antenna body can be effectively reduced. The size and diameter of the designed antenna is 150 mm, and the radial distance is reduced by 25 % compared with that without miniaturization. The antenna model can be bent arbitrarily to improve the complicated installation process of the built-in rigid antenna. But the Archimedes spiral antenna needs impedance matching device Balun, the existence of Balun for the antenna's built-in brings great inconvenience. Therefore, this paper proposes to reduce the overall antenna impedance while greatly reducing the overall antenna volume by co-planar Balun with the antenna body. Through simulation, it can be seen that changing the antenna gap ratio can reduce the antenna VSWR, but there is a problem that the frequency band with VSWR less than 2 is less. Based on this, this paper combines the design idea of exponential gradient Balun, and uses the gradient gap ratio to make the antenna impedance change smoother. Finally, through simulation, it is determined that the gradual gap ratio can make the working frequency band move to the relatively low frequency. Because the UHF radiated by PD signal is mostly in the range of 300 MHz～1.5 GHz, the gradual gap ratio mode is finally determined for the physical antenna. After the completion of the actual production, the vector network analyzer was used to test the bending standing wave ratio of the antenna. The measured performance was slightly different from the simulation, but the variation trend was basically the same. Through the comparison between the experimental platform and the mature antenna, it can be seen that the flexible antenna can obviously receive partial discharge signals, and PD signals can be detected under different bending degrees. The results show that the antenna can effectively monitor the discharge signal through the experiment of GIS simulation cavity tank. In this paper, through the research of antenna body and Balun co-planar flexible miniaturized Archimedes antenna sensor, the influence of changing antenna gap ratio on antenna impedance was analyzed. At the same time, the antenna base was changed to PI flexible material, which provided a new idea for the built-in antenna, and the performance of the designed antenna was analyzed and verified through simulation and experiment. Experiments show that the antenna has excellent radiation performance and meets the detection requirements of the built-in antenna. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press. All rights reserved."

100,Tian S.; Liu B.; Deng G.; Zhang X.; Li H.; Liu W.; Chen H.,Study on the Compatibility of C6F12O Gas Mixture with EPDM; [C6F12O混 合 气 体 与 三 元 乙 丙 橡 胶 的 相 容 性 研 究],2024,Gongcheng Kexue Yu Jishu/Advanced Engineering Sciences,"Objective SF6 is widely used in electrically insulated equipment due to its excellent insulating properties. However, its global warming potential is 23 500 times greater than that of CO2, with an atmospheric lifespan of up to 3200 years. As the severity of global warming intensifies, finding a new environmentally friendly insulating gas to reduce the using of SF6 has become a hot research topic in recent years. C6F12O has both environmental benign characteristics and insulating properties, which has attracted the attention of scholars. However, the liquefaction temperature of pure C6F12O gas is 49 ℃ at atmospheric pressure, which is difficult to use as an insulating medium in practical engineering scenarios. It must be mixed with low-boiling point buffer gases, including CO2 and N2. It has been shown that a gas mixture comprising 4% C6F12O/CO2, when pressurized above 0.14 MPa, can be used as an insulating gas in 10 kV switchgear. For new eco-friendly insulation gas, its compatibility with the internal sealing materials of the equipment is also need to be considered. Method The experimental study on the compatibility between the C6F12O/CO2 gas mixture and the sealing rubber EPDM was carried out by building a thermally accelerated compatibility experimental platform in this paper. The effect of trace O2 on the compatibility of C6F12O gas mixture and EPDM was investigated by adding a small amount of O2 into the gas mixture. The changes in the surface morphology, the elements of rubber samples, the gas mixture components, and the mechanical properties were analyzed before and after the experiments. The interaction between C6F12O/CO2/O2 gas mixture and rubber was also calculated based on the MD theory. Results and Discussions The results from scanning electron microscopy showed that the scaly structures appeared on the surface of EPDM when mixed with C6F12O/CO2 at 110 °C. A flocculent structure appeared when EPDM was mixed with C6F12O/CO2/O2 at only 90 °C. This observation suggested that the inclusion of O2 promotes the interaction between the C6F12O/CO2 gas mixture and EPDM, which in turn leads to the corrosion of EPDM. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that a decrease in the carbon content alongside increases in oxygen and fluorine within the C6F12O/CO2 mixed EPDM with increasing temperature. This trend indicated that C6F12O/CO2 reacts with EPDM. In group of C6F12O/CO2/O2, the changes were more significant, which indicate that O2 promoted the reaction between the C6F12O/CO2 mixture and EPDM. Post-experimental analyses identified new spectral peaks at 284.5 eV, 285.8 eV and 289.2 eV, corresponding to C—C, C—H and —COO— ester bonds, respectively. Three characteristic peaks of elemental F were detected on the EPDM surface for metal fluoride at 683 eV, organofluoride at 684.5 eV, and —CF2CH2— at 687 eV. The intensity of C characteristic peak was significantly lower, while the intensity of O and F were higher in the C6F12O/CO2/O2 gas mixture after testing. These findings indicated that O2 actively participates in the reaction between the C6F12O/CO2 mixture and the EPDM, fostering an intensified interaction. The results of tensile properties showed that the mechanical properties of EPDM decreased significantly with increasing temperature. The mechanical property of EPDM in C6F12O/CO2 atmosphere was slightly worse than those of the original samples. The mechanical property of EPDM under C6F12O/CO2/O2 was worse than that of C6F12O/CO2. The reaction between the C6F12O/CO2 mixture and EPDM was more intensive after adding O2, leading to a significant decrease in the mechanical properties of EPDM. At the end of the experiment, a small amount of the resultant gas was collected and subjected to Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for further analysis. The small amount of H2O remaining inside the gas tank was involved in the decomposition reaction of the C6F12O gas mixture. Throughout the reaction, H· and OH· were generated from the decomposition of H2O, which can interact with particles such as CF3· , C3F7· , and F· produced by C6F12O to produce decomposition products such as C3F6 and C3F7H. Meanwhile, the reaction rate of the C6F12O gas mixture with EPDM and the concentration of C3F6 and C3F7H were increased by both the increasing temperature and O2 introduction. The diffusion coefficient D indicates that the diffusion speed of gas molecules in EPDM can reflect the physicochemical relationship between the gas and the solid material. The diffusion coefficients of both C6F12O and CO2 in EPDM increased with rising temperatures. At 110 °C, the diffusion coefficients of C6F12O and CO2 were increased by 1.71 and 2.49 times, respectively, following O2 addition. It indicates that the internal energies of gas molecules were increased by adding O2, and the C6F12O and CO2 gas molecules could be easier to diffuse on the EPDM surface and interact with EPDM. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) quantifies alterations in molecular interaction energy during miscibility and aids in determining the solubility of binary mixtures. A value of χ tending towards 0 indicates good compatibility between the mixed systems. Meanwhile, the parameter (χ) tends to be linear with the mixing energy (ΔEmix). Both χ and ΔEmix values of the EPDM mixing system decreased with increasing temperature. The χ and ΔEmix of the CO2/EPDM mixing system at different temperatures were higher than those of the C6F12O/EPDM blend system, which suggested that C6F12O was soluble with EPDM while CO2 struggles to establish a stable system. The χ and ΔEmix values of the system were decreased after adding O2, indicating that the internal energy of C6F12O and CO2 gas molecules was enhanced by O2, thereby enhancing their interaction with EPDM molecular chains. Conclusions The corrosion of the EPDM surface intensifies with the increase of temperature and the addition of O2 leading to a decline in the elongation at break and tensile strength. The fluorine-containing groups generated by the decomposition of C6F12O and EPDM not only interact with EPDM molecules, but also react with the additives inside EPDM to form metal fluorides and organic fluorides. Given its large molecular diameter, C6F12O possesses a diffusion coefficient significantly lower than that of CO2 at various temperatures, making it difficult to react with EPDM molecules. Conversely, the compact CO2 molecules boast a large diffusion coefficient, yet CO2’s chemical stability precludes its combination with EPDM. The increase in temperature and the addition of O2 will reduce the interaction parameters and mixing energy of the C6F12O/EPDM and CO2/EPDM binary blends, making it easier to interact with EPDM. © 2024 Sichuan University.

Once the insulation defect of GIS appears, it is easy to cause equipment failure and lead to huge loss. Therefore, it is essential to detect the partial discharge signals of GIS in operation. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of PD patterns in GIS, a PD pattern recognition method based on S transform denoising was proposed in this paper. Firstly, partial discharge signals of simulated GIS models were collected by ultrasonic method, and then we used the S transform method to filter noise in partial discharge signals, then we extracted the signal statistical characteristics of partial discharge, using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features. Support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify the partial discharge signals in this paper. The experimental results show that the S transform method is more effective than the traditional wavelet method in signal denosing of Bubble discharge, Floating discharge, Tip discharge and Creeping discharge in GIS.

In this process, Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is used in a wide range. The disconnect switch is the most frequently operated unit in GIS, and during use, the contact surface is constantly worn, resulting in a change in the contact state, which causes the abnormal temperature rise of the GIS disconnect switch. The research on the influencing factors of contact temperature is conducive to the non-invasive monitoring of contact temperature, reducing the failure of GIS disconnect switch and prolonging its service life. In this paper, a simplified model of the GIS disconnector is established, and the multi-field coupling simulation calculation of the electromagnetic-fluid-temperature field of the GIS disconnect switch is carried out, and the effects of contact resistance, ambient temperature and load current on the contact temperature are studied. The results show that the most serious temperature rise is concentrated around the contacts, and the contact temperature has an obvious functional relationship with the contact resistance, the ambient temperature and the load current, among which the contact temperature, the contact resistance and the ambient temperature satisfy the primary function relationship, and the contact temperature and the load current satisfy the quadratic function relationship.  © 2023 IEEE."

In this paper, we propose a new training criteria for RNN-T based E2E ASR and SLU to transfer BERT's knowledge into these systems. In the first stage of our proposed mechanism, we improve ASR performance by using a fine-grained, tokenwise knowledge transfer from BERT. In the second stage, we fine-tune the ASR model for SLU such that the above knowledge is explicitly utilized by the RNN-T model for improved performance. Our techniques improve ASR performance on the Switchboard and CallHome test sets of the NIST Hub5 2000 evaluation and on the recently released SLURP dataset on which we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance.

The results show that the GIS electric field network is a correlation framework that conforms to the characteristics of the scale-free and small-world network. With the evolution of electric field network degree distribution, the average degree and average mean of each module in GIS are decreased.

Taking a 7.2 kV HV switchgear as an example, we analyzed the shortcomings of the existing pressure relief channel, and put forward the improved design method of the pressure relief channel. Based on the NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II), and the SCM (standard calculation method) considering the pressure relief vent, the related parameters of the improved pressure relief channel were designed optimally. Then the optimal improvement project of the pressure relief channel was obtained. The results show that the deficiency of the existing pressure relief channel is made up effectively by adding the buffer chamber and arc guide channel at the top of the switchgear. After the pressure relief channel being improved, the average impulse and pressure peak of the switchgear door and partition are reduced obviously. The larger the size of pressure relief cover, the volume of buffer chamber and arc guidance channel, the better the effect of pressure relief. The proposed optimal design project of the pressure relief channel improves the safety and reliability of the switchgear. The results can be promoted to the HV switchgears in other voltages. © 2020, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI. All right reserved."

By building a set of 220 kV high-voltage direct current (HVDC) GIS experiment platforms and manufacturing four different types of insulation defects (including multiple sizes and positions), 180,828 pulse current signals under multiple voltage levels are successfully measured. Then, the apparent discharge quantity and the discharge time, two inherent physical quantities unaffected by the experimental platform and measurement system, are obtained after the pulse current signal is denoised, according to which 70 statistical features are extracted. In this paper, a pattern recognition method based on generalized discriminant component analysis driven support vector machine (SVM) is detailed and the corresponding selection criterion of involved parameters is established. The results show that the newly proposed pattern recognition method greatly improves the recognition accuracy of fault diagnosis in comparison with 36 kinds of state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms and 44 kinds of state-of-the-art classifiers. This newly proposed method not only solves the difficulty that phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) cannot be applied under DC condition but also immensely facilitates the fault diagnosis of HVDC GIS. © 2021 by the authors.

134,Gu F.-C.,Identification of partial discharge defects in gas-insulated switchgears by using a deep learning method,2020,IEEE Access,"In this study, a novel method based on deep learning was developed for partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition. Traditional PD recognition methods are crucial for extracting features from PD patterns. The method of extracting crucial features is the key to PD pattern identification. The fractal theory is commonly used to determine the features of discharge patterns. The feature distribution of different defect types can be determined according to the fractal dimensions and lacunarity. However, finding fractal features is a complicated process. In this study, a PD image was entered as an input into a deep learning system to reduce the complexity of finding features. First, four defect type of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) experimental models are established. Then, an LDP-5 inductive sensor (L-sensor) was used to measure the ground line signals caused by PD phenomenon. Second, these electrical signals were transformed into the most representative 3D (nq) PD patterns. Finally, a convolutional neural network was employed for PD image pattern recognition. A total of 160 sets of PD patterns were measured using a 15-kV GIS. The results obtained with the proposed method were compared with those obtained with the fractal method. The results revealed that the proposed method is easy to use and can easily distinguish various defect types.

Then dynamic characteristics analysis and seismic time history response analysis are carried out for the overall model of integrative building-floor GIS electrical equipment and the model of integrative building without considering the floor equipment. The results show that: ① The first 3 order frequency and the structural mode of the main structure model and the main-attached structure model are similar; ②the peak acceleration amplification factor of second floor exceeds 2.0; the peak acceleration amplification factor of third floor exceeds 3.0; ③because of the vertical vibration of the GIS cantilever bushing, the stress response of the root of hanger and the end of the GIS cantilever bushing is large.

A temperature rise test has to be performed in order to make sure that the allowed temperature limits are not exceeded. To optimise the number of needed design tests, it is important to predict the temperature rise with a simulation tool. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, used widely in medium voltage circuit breakers, can produce a potent greenhouse effect if released into the atmosphere. Among the alternatives, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and its mixtures are considered promising. In this paper, a comparative study of thermal behaviour SF6 and CO2 in medium voltage switchgear is studied. Experimental investigations were also carried out to verify the simulation results and good agreement was achieved. SF6 gas exhibited the smallest temperature rise in comparison to CO2. Additional simulations were carried out to assess the effect of conductor contact resistances, ambient temperature and increased load current levels. The simulation tool allows a number of iterative simulations to be performed in order to investigate design parameters, operating and fault conditions which are potentially difficult, destructive and costly to set up and test.

The levitated metallic particles affect the high-voltage conductor and cause serious dielectric problems such as partial discharge and dielectric breakdown. This problem can be solved by applying a resistive coating inside the GIS that suppresses the levitation of metallic particles. However, in the case of resistive coatings, the unit cost is high, so when applied entirely inside the GIS, a considerable cost is incurred. For this reason, considering economic feasibility, an efficient application area is required, and the behavioral characteristics of metallic particles should be analyzed. In this paper, when AC and DC voltages are applied to a parallel plate, the motion characteristics of the shape and number of metallic particles and the lift-off voltage are tested. As a result, it was confirmed that the lift-off voltage decreased when the number of metallic particles increased in AC and DC voltage, and both the maximum bounce height and the first behavior width of particles increased. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2023."

The leading causes of insulation deterioration of gas-insulated switchgear are discharging along the surface caused by dirt on the insulating material, internal discharge caused by impurities and cavities in the insulating material, corona discharge caused by poor assembly or construction at the site, and electric tree channel discharge caused by the intense internal discharge. Since different defects produce different partial discharge characteristics, the operating power equipment can be analyzed using measurement instruments to detect partial discharge for preventive equipment fault diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary power outages and losses; therefore, evaluating the defects in gas-insulated switchgear is essential. In this study, three gas-insulated switchgears were prefabricated with different defects before encapsulation, and the partial discharge data of each defect were measured by applying different test voltages. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) input data were used to evaluate the recognition effect, showing that the average recognition rate of the core for all defects was over 90%.

As a result, large span areas that are essentially required for housing Electrical Extra High Voltage Gas Insulated Switchgears could not be covered by simple frames and required complex frame arrangements thereby increasing the required completion time. For design, steel has been the preferred material because of its ductile, strength, flexible, recyclability nature and low cost. With technology transfers, entrepreneurs had established steel centres where entire design to production is carried under one roof and the product is erected at site. These factories had given advantage of fabricating components either ahead or parallel to the civil works at site, thus saving time. Introducing the concept of Pre-Engineered building (PEB) into structural design resulted in design optimization and many advantages, including economy and easier fabrication when compared with the Conventional Steel building (CSB). PEB construction is widely gaining popularity over regular conventional buildings in India due to its sheer advantage in time saving. However, there is a challenge of proper and optimized design suiting to the Electrical Substation requirements such as pressurized atmospheric environment, Maintenance walkways, entry of electrical Bus ducts at various levels and locations. Any overlooking of the above may lead to overall failure of the electrical system. This would make it unique from the normal conventional PEB buildings done for Ware houses, Factories, etc. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The Department of “Water Supply, Water Disposal and Hydro-technical construction” of the KG UCTA named after N. Isanov for two years conducted a study on the use of cheap local raw materials for the filter loading of fine water filters. Sand from Kyrgyz deposits was used as a loading. The aim of the experiments was to consider the physical picture of the process of water clarification by filtration and the factors characterizing it, to study the features of the filter layers in terms of the loading height and depending on the grain diameter, as well as to determine the parameters of technological modeling for subsequent optimization of the process. The results obtained on the “short” columns were tested on a pilot plant, which is a conventional column with a full height of the filter load, calculated on the basis of technological modeling data. The operating conditions of the pilot plant generally corresponded to the operating conditions of the process simulation plant. The task is to create a simple and affordable device for use in national conditions, in which it would be possible to use a filter load from a natural non-toxic material for the human body, which does not have high operational qualities, for a sufficiently long time to purify drinking water. All technological schemes for the treatment of drinking water quality from surface sources using a rapid non-pressure filter are several times cheaper than similar schemes with filter loads from the Russian Federation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This switchgear system can connect distributed generations such as photovoltaic and wind turbine generation, and AC and DC loads. The proposed switchgear system consists of an inverter for connecting distributed generations and DC load, a static transfer switch (STS) that can control and interrupt the bidirectional power flow, and an intelligent electronic device (IED) that can control each facility using a communication system. Since the topology inside the switchgear is composed of DC bus, it can be operated as a plug-in type of system that can be used by simply connecting the converters of various distributed generations to the inverter in the developed switchgear system.

Therefore, in order to accurately and timely master the impact of VFTO on the operation status of GIS and transformer, it is necessary to constantly monitor the VFTO level caused by the operation of circuit breakers and disconnectors of GIS. In this paper an VFTO on-line monitoring system based on the ultra-wide band capacitive sensing is designed for 500 kV transformer and GIS equipment of a large hydropower station. Capacitance sensing transformation is carried out on the cover plate of the connecting cylinder of GIS equipment and transformer. Signal conversion and acquisition are implemented locally at the monitoring terminal, and uploaded to the upper storage control unit through optical fiber. The effective measurement bandwidth of the monitoring system ranges from 2.1 Hz to 230 MHz, the sampling rate is 250 MS/s, and the analog bandwidth is 100 MHz. The abrupt voltage waveform can be accurately captured by customized steep trigger mode, and the recording time is not less than 200 ms. The vert fast transient overvoltage waveforms caused by the disconnector and circuit breaker are recorded successfully and accurately by the on-line monitoring system. Through data analysis, it is found that the duration of VFTO waveform caused by disconnector operation is less than 5 μs, the rising edge is less than 60 ns, the main spectrum is between 1 MHz and 10 MHz, and the maximum instantaneous frequency at the rising edge can reach 100 MHz; The duration of VFTO waveform caused by circuit breaker operation is less than 30ms, the rising edge is less than 100 ns, the main spectrum is between 10 kHz and 1 MHz, and the maximum instantaneous frequency at the rising edge also can reach 100 MHz. The VFTO simulation model of the GIS and transformer equipment can be optimized by the measured waveform of the overvoltage on-line monitoring system, which lays a solid foundation for improving the protection level of VFTO and analyzing the causes of equipment failure. © 2020, Xi'an High Voltage Apparatus Research Institute Co., Ltd.

During a development process, prototypes and laboratory tests will be required to make sure the temperature rises are within acceptable limits as defined by standards. The aim of having a tool to predict the temperature rise, is to reduce the number of prototypes and test loops needed in the laboratory during a development period. Advanced simulation tools such as CFD can give valuable results, however, they require expertise user and extensive compute and manpower allocation. This paper presents a practical design approach developed for providing a first, quick and rough estimate of the temperature rise of the most critical parts in an air insulated switchgear. The main idea behind the method is to first use the method described in IEC 60890 to estimate the temperature rise of the gas inside the switchgear. Then, simplified heat transfer calculations are used to estimate the over-temperature of critical parts relative to the surrounding gas. The accuracy of the temperature estimates will depend on how well the power input is known, especially the contact resistances.

The arc fault involves a pressure load, which has to be taken into account in the structural design of the system. In order to estimate the pressures that occur, arc fault pressure calculations are carried out using different methods. The paper focuses on a transformer substation (a precast concrete construction) with an internal arc fault in the medium voltage switchgear. The pressures simulated before the test are compared to the values measured during the test. With the recorded electrical quantities and the pressure, the thermal transfer coefficient, which can be used for new simulations, is then determined as an essential input parameter for the pressure simulation. In addition, the effect of an absorber grille in the relief path is examined, and the pressure plots before and after this energy-dissipating element are compared. In preparation for the arc fault test, the pressure plots in the transformer substation are calculated using two different commercial programs. During the experiment, the initial pressure of an arc fault initiated in a controlled way is measured in the cable basement with piezoelectric pressure sensors. The pressure plots are compared with the values measured during the internal arc fault test. The pressure that builds up in the switching chamber (inner metal housing of the switchgear) due to the arc is measured with a piezoresistive pressure sensor. Together with the calculation of the power conversion of the arc, the thermal transfer coefficient of the switchgear is determined at the beginning. This way, an important parameter for the pressure calculation can be determined by means of space-averaging and spatially resolved pressure calculation methods. Thus, a contribution can be made to improve these methods and to bring the simulation closer to practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Österreichischer Verband für Elektrotechnik (OVE)."

A topology optimization method was applied to optimize the electric (E) field distribution of a 126-kV disk-type spacer with actual size. The spatial distribution of relative permittivity (ϵr) inside spacer was designed to improve the E-field distributions along the spacer surface and near the triple junction region. Influences of design parameters on ϵr distributions and the resultant E-field mitigation degree were analyzed. Appropriate values of design parameters that balance the structure processability and E-field mitigation results were selected. A three-layer dielectrically graded spacer, including high, medium, and low ϵr regions, was constructed based on the topology optimization results. In addition, the influence of the area of design domain on the optimization results was analyzed. Numerical results indicate that the E-field distribution of designed dielectrically graded spacers is significantly improved compared with that of a homogeneous spacer.

One of the grids has a quartz shell replaced by polyimide, synthesized using a fiber coating with a full multiplicative response to temperature and deformation caused by humidity. The second grating recorded in a standard fiber and responds to temperature. It is possible to include an additional third grating with a partially etched cladding, which can be used for refract metric measurements of the amount of condensed moisture on the elements of a complete switchgear. All gratings are identical, have the same Bragg wavelength, after manipulating their claddings, but differ in a unique address, which is formed by recording two transparency windows in each of the gratings with different difference frequency space. The transparency windows correspond to phase I€-shifts symmetrically located at the same distance from the center of each of the gratings. The structure obtained makes it possible to record information of the measurement conversion at the indicated difference frequencies in the radio range, which significantly increases the speed of measurements of relative humidity and their accuracy by an order of magnitude. In addition to what has been said, it is possible to note the possibility of building a network of these sensors in consecutively arranged switchgear devices, with a different radiofrequency address group being used in each of them. © 2020 SPIE.

It is emphasized that the implementation of protection on reed switches is impossible without dedicated mounting near the conductors of electrical installations. It is noted that a number of models of such mounts have already been developed, while further advancement in this direction is required as well. Three new designs of measuring devices of protection are proposed for mounting reed switches near the busbars of cubicle switchboards arranged horizontally in a row, and near the busbars of bundled conductors located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The first mount differs from the known designs by the presence of a plate with reed switches, a plate with a scale and a rod with a thread and a handle. The second is a C-shaped platform with a support insulator, a case with a lid and a plate with reed switches.

Wide diversity of epoxy composites make its application in different industries such as coating, insulator, electric components, adhesives, sound acquisition, automobile, packaging, construction material, etc. The major application of epoxy composites is in the area of thermal insulation such as electric switch board, decorative article coating, tiles, and other civil constructions works. Another important property of epoxy composite is of good electric insulator as compared to metal matrix composites. But there are also some limitations such as low impact strength, nonbiodegradability, delamination, brittleness, and fracture toughness behavior, which limit its applications. To overcome these limitations, certain measures have been taken by different researchers such as incorporation of natural fibers, modification in chemical structure, particle reinforcement, etc.. Natural fibers come out as one of the prominent sources of reinforcement material for polymer composites due to their high strength and modulus of the fibers, fiber dispersion, fiber-matrix adhesion, and increase in toughness of the matrix. In this chapter overview of natural fibers with their advantages and disadvantages as reinforcement material in polymer composites has been provided. Studies of thermosetting polymer mainly epoxy resin including its thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties also have been done.

Users performing arc flash risk assessments are left to apply engineering judgment when considering how barriers or isolation of components should be considered. This can lead to risk assessments that are inconsistent or incorrect. Current practices regarding arc flash evaluation in barriered and nonbarriered equipment are reviewed based on current standards. Gaps and potential concerns are discussed, including the lack of defined criteria to use in calculations, along with lack of criteria for determining when barrier systems are considered effective at preventing, mitigating, controlling, or containing arcing faults. A description of a new system that provides passive protection in low-voltage distribution equipment is presented. By providing improved protection for the incoming conductors and main circuit breaker itself, this line-side protection system reduces or eliminates the uncertainties, which allows for more consistent and accurate application of risk assessments. The new protection system enables arc flash protection to be provided by a passive, enclosed system that has been tested to verify performance. As such, the calculations and risk assessment are less reliant on assumptions regarding the performance of the equipment.

An alternating voltage regulator based on a transformer with a partitioned secondary winding and a semiconductor switch has been proposed. It has been shown that such a construction of a voltage regulator is equivalent to a transformer with an adjustable transformation coefficient. The problem of obtaining the maximum number of discrete levels of transformation coefficients for a fixed number of sections of the secondary winding of the transformer has been considered. A circuit of a semiconductor switchboard has been presented, which provides voltage regulation on the reactive element of the compensator relative to the mains voltage in the direction of decreasing or increasing. A circuit of a switchboard based on bidirectional thyristor switches has been proposed. The analysis of electromagnetic processes in the reactive-power compensator has been carried out. The main calculation ratios determining currents, voltages, and installed capacities of the elements of the compensator power circuit depending on the transformer transformation coefficient have been given. It has been shown that, with this approach to the construction of a reactive-power compensator, its equivalent replacement circuit relative to the input terminals is represented by an adjustable reactive element.

The building was in the final stage of construction, but many of the ‘passages’ of the installation through the walls and ceilings were not yet fire-protected, ie., the fire integrity requirement was not met. It results that a spread of fire was much larger than could be expected. The research carried out in order to assess the condition of the structure after the fire were presented, in particular the selection of members that: (1) had to be dismantled, (2) required significant strengthening or repair, (3) could be used after only minor cleaning works. Due to the short time to carry out the assessment, it was mainly based on non-destructive tests (NDT) results. The conclusions from the conducted assessment and analyzes were presented. A small and seemingly easy to control fire, which started in the underground garage, spread up to 12 storeys above ground level. The fire was difficult to control due to incomplete works in the field of securing installation passages through the partitions. These works were to be carried out in the final stage of the construction of the building, while the electrical installation was already in use. Damage to reinforced concrete members had an unexpectedly large extent due to thermal spalling of the concrete. Significant intensification of this phenomenon was caused by the high moisture content in ‘relatively young concrete’ (short drying time from casting the members) and the close location of the burning electrical wires in relation to the structural members. The possibilities of estimating, but still sufficiently reliable, assessment of damage to members using NDT was pointed out. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

How to find an effective real-time model that can be applied to the UPIoT mobile terminals has become an urgent problem needing to be solved. To this end, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) for GIS partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition using three lightweight convolutional blocks, and introduces the lowest recognition accuracy of single-class faults as the primary indicator for selecting the optimal model under the UPIoT. First, three lightweight convolutional blocks are introduced for constructing an LCNN. Then, the optimal model constructed by the lightweight blocks is sought. Next, criteria for determining the best model are introduced, and the best model under the UPIoT is selected. This study provides a reference standard for the construction of GIS PD pattern recognition under the UPIoT. Meanwhile, through the balance of evaluation indicators, this study verifies that the minimum recognition accuracy of the MnasNet model is 98.8%, which is obviously better than other methods and lays a solid foundation for GIS PD pattern recognition. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020"

Most of the faults are caused by the neutral interconnection in the wiring system. Usually neutral wires are connected to neutral bus within the panel board or switchboard, and are ""bonded"" to earth ground. In our secondary distribution, tree system of supply is mostly utilized. The voltage of each phase to neutral will be maintained at rated value even during the unbalanced load conditions. If neutral wire connection is poor the voltage at each phase will be different from one another, such an isolated neutral point is called floating neutral and the voltage of the point is always changing. This is the reason for over voltage causing damage to appliance’s which should be protected.

Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) panels can be installed in any water body, viz. lakes, balancing reservoirs, backwaters, dam reservoirs etc. However, the FPV system is very complex due to the involvement of multiple types of equipment to name a few: - floats, anchoring & mooring system, solar modules, string monitoring unit, power conditioning units, LV switchgear, cables, inverter transformer, AC & DC cables, lightning arrestors etc. Further, this complexity increases during different project phases (erection, installation, towing of arrays, commissioning etc.), with variable water depth due to bathymetry and frequent water level changes in the case of a dam reservoir. In addition to that, system connection must be flexible with modular installation. Worldwide, FPV is gaining commercial interest due to its low LCOE and researcher interest due to its vast research potential. One significant challenge in the design, engineering & installation of FPV is the unavailability of international codes & standards. The only recommended practice for FPV is DNVGLRP-0584, which still requires many improvements. While designing the system, most industries follow the extreme wind conditions applicable for buildings but do not precisely describe the situation specific to floating solar. In the recent past, one of the floating solar parks collapsed due to a strong wind gust[1]. A solar array is first modelled in the present work, and its aerodynamics is investigated through CFD in ANSYS FLUENT. A parametric study is then carried out with the variable inclination angle of solar panels. The wind loads are then compared with a standard analytical approach considering the wind pressure acting on the projected area. An optimized size of the solar array is recommended based on CFD loads at a particular inclination angle of the solar panel. Such a study helps design an FPV park without the code.

Firstly, the reason for the temperature rise of the switchgear is analyzed under the condition of considering the long-term working system in the thermal calculation of electrical engineering, and a real-time transient thermal circuit model is established. Then measure the physical resistance value of the switchgear circuit, and at the same time measure the heat dissipation area of the heating position through solidworks software, obtain the relationship between the heat dissipation coefficient and the temperature rise through the empirical formula of the heat dissipation coefficient, and fit the curve of the heat dissipation coefficient changing with the temperature rise. Collect the temperature rise test data, use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the differential equation, calculate the temperature change of each conductor under the transient current, and then use the relative temperature difference method as the grade criterion for overheating faults. By building a high-current temperature rise test platform for switchgear, and comparing the calculation results with the test results, it can be seen that the model has high real-time calculation accuracy for conductor temperature, and can provide theoretical support for online monitoring of switchgear operating status and fault early warning.

As generation of electrical energy mostly comes from fossil fuel-based energy sources which turns to the significant environmental impacts. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development a country must concentrate on efficient management and conservation of energy. To focus on this issue the uses and demand of different Energy Management System (EMS) is rising. Energy management system helps to reduce power consumption, cost, suffering and increase reliability, resilience and the comfort level.

The ubiquitous power Internet of Things (UPIoT), which is characterized by its online monitoring of failure samples for database building and further processing, is of great use in identifying potential insulation defects. We propose a MixNet deep learning model (MDLM) in the UPIoT context with the aim of optimizing partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition, after taking into account multiple indicators such as accuracy and effectiveness. Furthermore, a generative adversarial network was adopted for data enhancement to improve the model's generalization ability and to solve such problems as noise jamming and the less clear effect of traditional spatial transformation methods on unified PD specification data. We found that an MDLM can effectively improve fault diagnosis accuracy while largely reducing calculation and storage costs. After validation, the recognition accuracy of an MDLM was 99.1%, significantly higher than that of other methods. The advantages of the proposed method were also demonstrated by the model feature extraction and the last hidden fully-connected layer using a visualization method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Although such resilient devices can rarely suffer from failure, partial discharge (PD) is responsible for around 85% of their recorded collapses. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) techniques have been widely used in the detection and localization of PD for a long time because of their immunity to noise and high sensitivity. Understanding electromagnetic (EM) wave behavior in GIS systems is significant for improving the utilization of UHF sensors in PD detection and for the optimal allocation of UHF antennas inside GIS systems. Thus, this paper is devoted to building a detailed 3D finite element (FE) model based on UHF detection techniques to understand the propagation behavior of EM waves inside GIS. A disk-type UHF sensor is used for acquiring EM waves inside the GIS. The sensitivity of the sensor has been obtained using a gigahertz transverse-electromagnetic (GTEM) test cell. The proposed model investigates the impact of multiple disconnecting parts including L-structure, relative angle between PD source and sensors, and disconnecting switches on the propagation of electromagnetic waves based on step 1 of the CIGRE recommendations. To validate the modeled GIS, a simple L-structured model is initially built, and a comparative analysis has been conducted between the built model and the experimental and analytical results from the literature.  © 2001-2012 IEEE."

UECC’s two existing LNG-fuelled vessels Auto Eco and Auto Energy are the biggest 1A super Finnish/Swedish ice classed PCTC and the first PCTC in the world capable of operating on LNG. They are capable of sailing a 14-day round trip in the Baltic solely on LNG, storing approximately 800 cu m in a cylindrical Type C tank, and were the first clients of the world’s first seagoing LNG bunkering vessel, ENGIE Zeebrugge. The company is now building a series of three further vessels that will be the first LNG battery hybrid PCTCs in the world. The energy storage system (ESS) system will be charged by a permanent magnet, directly driven shaft generator or dual fuel generators. As part of the total power system, which includes a WinGD 6RT-Flex50DF dual-fuel engine, a controllable pitch propeller, a bulb rudder, two dual-fuel gensets and a dual-fuel boiler, the ESS will provide power to the main switchboard, peak shaving capabilities for the main engine and auxiliaries and offer black-out prevention. The vessels will only require two auxiliaries, as the ESS and the shaft generator eliminate the need for one more that would otherwise have been required. The pioneering design will take UECC beyond the IMO target of 40% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 through the combination of optimal hull design and the LNG battery hybrid solution."

The exclusion of economic factors from consideration when designing switchgears for substations is also due to the lack of time for a design engineer involved in the development of large-scale project documentation, and additional calculations under the conditions suitable for the end of the project execution period completely exclude the possibility of integrated accounting of all factors when choosing a switchgear circuit. The paper provides a description of the algorithm for selecting the appropriate option for the layout of an open distribution device for substations of 35-220 kV. The algorithm is based on the method of direct enumeration according to the criterion of the minimum reduced costs for the construction, repair and operation of the switchgear of substations. Possible variants of substation switchgear schemes and layouts are determined on the basis of the requirements of regulatory documents and ensure the required reliability, economy and safety.

Harvesting this heat in an efficient and cost-effective way improve overall systems efficiency and reduce energy costs. Numerous studies shed light on these sources and technologies to utilize low-temperature heat. This paper evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of low-temperature Stirling Engine (SE) powered by hot water energy from evacuated tube solar water heater for distributed power generation when excess hot water energy is available. Evacuated tube solar collector provides hot water on-demand. When hot water is not consumed domestically, a SE is used to utilize the untapped heat from the solar water heater. The objective of this study is to evaluate the energy savings by using a SE to recover untapped heat from solar collectors. Thermal performance of the selected evacuated tube was measured experimentally under local weather conditions for different periods in summer and winter in the Mediterranean region and then simulated on hourly basis for a whole year to estimate the energy and hot water temperature output. Three different cases were taken to assess the potential of energy savings using SE to generate power namely, typical homes, office buildings and schools. SE is modeled using the most advanced thirdorder design analysis method. Air, helium, and hydrogen are used as working fluids in the SE at different charging pressures. Results obtained from solar collector's thermal performance for the three cases are integrated with the results achieved from Stirling engine simulation of the various working fluids and pressures to evaluate the engine performance based on a dynamic approach. The study also investigates the economic feasibility of using Stirling engines for power generation from such low-temperature, intermittent heat sources. Results show that using hydrogen as working fluid is the most feasible. Typical schools show the most economical case to recover heat Copyright © 2017 ASME."

207,Ding H.; Chen K.; Huo Q.,Improving Knowledge Distillation of CTC-Trained Acoustic Models with Alignment-Consistent Ensemble and Target Delay,2020,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing,"Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to improve the performance of a simpler student model by imitating the outputs or intermediate representations of a more complex teacher model. The most commonly used KD technique is to minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher and student models. When it is applied to compressing acoustic models trained with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion, an assumption is made that the teacher and student share the same frame-level feature-transcription alignment. However, frame-level alignments learned by teachers can be inaccurate and unstable due to the lack of fine-grained frame-level guidance during CTC training. Forcing student to learn inaccurate alignments will lead to limited performance improvements. In this article, we investigate building powerful teacher models with more accurate and stable feature-transcription alignments. We achieve this goal by using a novel alignment-consistent ensemble (ACE) technique, where all models within an ensemble are jointly trained along with a regularization term to encourage consistent and stable alignments. With well-trained deep bidirectional LSTM (DBLSTM) ACE as a teacher, we can directly use the traditional frame-wise KD method to train DBLSTM students. When applying KD to transfer knowledge from a DBLSTM ACE to a deep unidirectional LSTM (DLSTM) student, a simple yet effective target delay technique is proposed to handle the alignment difference between bidirectional and unidirectional models. Experimental results on Switchboard-I speech recognition task show that, with DBLSTM ACE as a teacher, the simple frame-wise KD method can achieve competitive or better performance than other complex KD methods on DBLSTM students. When applying KD to build DLSTM students from DBLSTM teachers, our proposed target delay technique can achieve relative word error rate reductions of 14.2%$\sim$14.8% compared with the models trained from scratch, which outperforms other carefully-designed KD methods.  © 2014 IEEE."

The proposed model aims to evaluate the influence of radiation intensity on the cavity receiver performance. The properties of the heat transfer fluid in the pipe and heat transfer losses of the receiver are investigated by varying the direct normal irradiance from 400W/m2 to 1000W/m2. The temperature of heat transfer fluid, as well as the effect of radiation intensity on the heat transfer losses have been critically presented and discussed. The simulation results reveal that the heat transfer fluid temperature and thermal efficiency of the receiver are significantly influenced by different radiation flux. With the increase of radiation intensity, the efficiency of the receiver will firstly increase, then drops after reaching the highest point. The outlet working fluid temperature of the pipe will be increased consistently. The results of the simulations show that the designed cylindrical receiver used in dish Stirling system is capable to achieve the targeted outlet temperature and heat transfer efficiency, with an acceptable pressure drop.

Currently, the main functions of robot or online monitoring systems operated by substations are to provide human-assisted inspections, not automatic identification or calibration. Combined with the actual conditions of smart grid substations and construction requirements, this paper proposes an algorithm based on computer intelligent vision technology that can be used for the automatic identification of typical outdoor circuit breakers and disconnectors and the position state of indoor switchgears. Firstly, a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm was used to accurately locate the area to be detected. Then, image preprocessing technology was used to remove noise points and extract edge information. The randomized Hough transform was used to extract the line information of the disconnector and the circle information of the switchgear, and k-NN (k nearest neighbor) was used to extract and identify the written character information on the circuit breaker. Finally, intelligent identification was set up using thresholds for three types of power equipment, and the algorithm was verified for a disconnector in a 500-kV substation in China and at the Qinghe substation. Based on actual measurements at these sites, the algorithm exhibited strong identification performance, stability, and high accuracy in identifying the position state of the switches in severe weather. It can be used to not only solve the current lack of effective automatic online monitoring of power equipment, but also serve as an important extension of many areas of smart grid research. © 2019 Totem Publisher, Inc.

Alongside the question of responsive motional control strategies, the search for a practical design setup is investigated aiming to establish a computational-oriented methodology that integrates information from both direct physical sensory data and indirect computational programming and organization of the input information.

User's physical actions are recorded via the synergy of multiple sensors and classified into two main categories. Computation of both data resulted on an enriched user motion decoding, and therefore the encoding of specific structural reactions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018. All rights reserved."

As the insulating medium of UHVAC switchgear,SF6 is likely to liquefy at low temperature,which may reduce the stability of the switchgear and increase the operation risk of the state grid. It is necessary to take measures to improve the cold-resistant ability of the switchgear. Based on the importance of different switchgear,it is appropriate to carry out indoor installation for 1 100 kV GIS. To some outdoor 1 100 kV busing and bus,reduce the SF6 pressure can make the liquefaction temperature lower to accommodate the cold environment. To 126 kV GIS and 550 kV GIS, it is effective to add heating devices around the switchgear,and heat it at certain procedure,which can keep the SF6 stable. All the measures have been tested by low temperature test.

Due to its small scale, microhydro development requires substantial upfront capital costs, maintenance and operation costs for customized engineering and construction. The significant investments required for developing small hydropower are inhibiting for utilities, residential and commercial users to adopt. An inexpensive energy storage system and a well-designed power controls system can be integrated with small hydropower sites to increase its cost-effectiveness and reliability. This paper introduces the concept of storing low-power generated from small hydro turbines during long off-peak periods and dispatching at highpower as grid-quality electricity during peak periods. The use of an ultra-low cost thermal energy storage (ULCTES) system is examined. Boosting the power output for small hydro generation allows commercial users to avoid significant demand charges during operation, making small hydro an attractive cost saving strategy and therefore breaking down the cost barrier. The ULCTES operates much like a bulk power production unit and a peaker plant, in which it is capable of dispatching constant power over a long period during peak periods when conventional sources are unavailable. Improvements in system reliability and economic value are evaluated using microgrid optimization software HOMER Energy. In particular, two cases are studied with variations in types of end users and energy management goals. Energy costs savings, demand charges savings and renewable energy penetration are determined. Distributed energy storage systems are shown to reduce energy costs and increase the renewable energy penetration for commercial users. With ULCTES, microgrids have the flexibility to manage fluctuating renewable energy generation as well as respond to rapidly changing loads on a daily basis. A larger hydroelectricity system is shown to be more feasible with distributed energy storage systems for isolated users without any connection to the grid. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

Electrical Engineers designing power systems for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or Petrochemical facilities typically use two-winding transformers to feed multiple process units in redundant distribution schemes throughout the facility. This method is repeated further to derive different voltage levels to feed process loads. As the industry moves towards larger production facilities which increase the power demand, multiple large two-winding transformers are utilized. This approach leads to increase in substation footprints, switchgear equipment, power feeders, site works, etc. This paper focuses on an alternative design using three-winding transformers for LNG or Petrochemical facilities. The input and output of a three-winding transformer generally consists of one primary (H) input, and two outputs defined as secondary (X) and tertiary (Y). Three-winding transformers are connected in a redundant configuration to feed multiple process units.

Statistical analysis is applied to study the characteristics of the highly unstable blade pass frequency (BPF) of the gas turbine and to establish the baseline data used for blade fault assessment and diagnosis.

The owner requested replacement of the 35-year-old switchboard to correct several issues, even though several efforts to stop water ingress were not successful. Elevation of the replacement switchboard to guard from contact with rainwater ingress was at first thought infeasible due to low deck-to-deck height in the parking garage. An alternate construction switchboard of shorter height was specified to permit elevation of a replacement switchboard at the original location. An office building interior was thoroughly renovated, with emphasis on flooding resiliency for ground-floor elements including a service switchboard. Sandbags at exterior doors and other evidence of occasional minor flooding of the ground floor emphasized the need for design measures to protect equipment. The electrical room floor-to-ceiling height was only 8′0″, leaving little room for device elevation beyond a standard concrete housekeeping pad.

As part of that initiative, Dominion purchased the necessary portable equipment, developed procedures, and implemented the FLEX strategies at its Surry, North Anna and Millstone nuclear power plants. A decision was also made to take credit for the FLEX strategies in Dominion fleet Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) models. FLEX was first implemented in the Surry PRA model. Since Surry Core Damage Frequency (CDF) was dominated with internal flooding scenarios in Turbine Building that propagate to Emergency Switchgear Room resulting an ELAP event, implementation of FLEX strategies in Surry PRA was expected to have a significant impact on Surry PRA results. In addition to flooding, FLEX recovery was also applied to a Station Blackout sequence with successful turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump and failure of offsite power restoration. The main function recovered by FLEX in either scenario was power supply for Steam Generator (SG) level control instrumentation. At Surry, this is provided by a Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) system connected to the Remote Monitoring Panel (RMT) for the first 12 hours. This design change was added as part of FLEX implementation. Plant procedures direct personnel to bring in and use a portable generator from the storage facility to power the RMT within 12 hours. Implementation of FLEX strategies in Surry PRA resulted in about 75% overall CDF reduction, which was reduced from 1.0E-05/yr to 2.53E-06/yr (similar reduction was seen for Unit 2). Flooding contribution to CDF was reduced from 47% to 17%, and Station Blackout (SBO) contribution to CDF reduced from 39% to 26%. The results for Unit 2 were similar to those of Unit 1. The conclusion is that implementation of FLEX strategies in Surry PRA does result in significant reduction in CDF and significant change in overall risk profile in terms of CDF contributors. © 2017 by American Nuclear Society.

Then, the very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO) is calculated when the transformer, the bus line and the outgoing line are switched. As to the calculation results, the influence of VFTO on transformer as well as the influence of cable on VFTO are analyzed. Analysis shows that VFTO amplitude at transformer port is small, but it may excite significant internal resonance voltage under highfrequency oscillation which may harm the turn insulation of power transformer. Besides, long cable connecting the ground part and underground part of GIS accelerates the attenuation of the transient progress. Finally, the case in which the most serious VFTO of transformer port appears is chosen as a model to research the VFTO's suppressing measure. The research reveals that building a 3-meter-long overhead line between GIS bushing and transformer can effectively keep the wave front steepness below the restriction level. The wave front steepness of VFTO decreases by 30.2% from 1631 kV/μs to 1138kV/μs. © 2018 IEEE."

This is because A2W models recognize words from speech without any decoder, pronunciation lexicon, or externally-trained language model, making training and decoding with such models simple. Prior work has shown that A2W models require orders of magnitude more training data in order to perform comparably to conventional models. Our work also showed this accuracy gap when using the English Switchboard-Fisher data set. This paper describes a recipe to train an A2W model that closes this gap and is at-par with state-of-the-art sub-word based models. We achieve a word error rate of 8.8.8%/13.9% on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard/CallHome test sets without any decoder or language model. We find that model initialization, training data order, and regularization have the most impact on the A2W model performance. Next, we present a joint word-character A2W model that learns to first spell the word and then recognize it. This model provides a rich output to the user instead of simple word hypotheses, making it especially useful in the case of words unseen or rarely-seen during training. © 2018 IEEE."

The replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers became scarce and expensive. The maintenance activities in severe and extremely hot middle-east weather conditions were cumbersome and time-consuming. A planned plant expansion with considerable incremental load to the facility provided an opportunity for a review of the complete electrical system. After a thorough review, it was decided to convert the main outdoor AIS to an indoor gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) substation to support the existing and new facilities. However, a total loss of power to the continuous operation of this critical gas facility was unacceptable. The existing switchyard with an energized 230 kV open bus system had limited space to safely perform the demolition and construction activities for the new GIS. Detailed analysis of the installation options, construction techniques, safety requirements, and logistical methods was performed to eliminate potential for any total loss of power. The construction activity involved interfacing with two separate redundant power supply sources, with separate transmission line protection systems and equipment. The parties involved worked together in reaching an agreement on engineering, procurement, installation, testing, and commissioning activities that would successfully implement this transition without any loss of power to the gas production facilities. © 2017 IEEE."

In the case without taking into account H2, the burners show poor ignitability. Using a multi-step mechanism for gas combustion, including char gasification and detailed compositions of volatile largely improve the ignitability of burners. The good ignitability also leads to more heat absorption in boiler and less CO in furnace. CO can be also increased because of the char gasification and detailed compositions of volatiles.

There can be two aspects to this: the shock and sound waves propagated from the expanding arc channel, and the bulk pressurization of the enclosure, if arcing is taking place within a closed volume. The present paper is the first systematic review of the research on both these pressure phenomena. Quantitative studies on electrical arc explosion pressures date back to the 1920s, although arc pressures generated by lightning, which is a type of electric arc discharge, have been studied since the 1700s, but understanding of the phenomena is still not complete or exhaustive. Experimental data are compared to theoretical predictions. It is shown that in an enclosed volume some extremely high pressures can be generated, if the arc current is sufficient. Such pressures can destroy buildings and mechanical equipment and cause injuries or death to nearby individuals. Even without enclosures, the shock waves produced from high energy arcs can cause injuries, although arc flash injury may be of greater concern. Injury potential generally requires that high currents be available, and serious damages or injuries are not associated with low-energy arcing occurrences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

250,Graessler I.; Yang X.,A holistic approach of complexity assessment for the development of product variants of mechatronic products and their supply chain networks,2019,IFAC-PapersOnLine,"In the last decades, the increasing globalization as well as an increasing competitive situation lead to individualized products. This change is accompanied by an increasing variant variety, which leads to a high level of complexity in supply chain networks (SCNs). In particular, suppliers of mechatronic systems have to face the challenge of the increasing complexity of variants and the complexity of its corresponding SCNs. Since the mechatronic systems consist of different components from different industries, suppliers are usually widespread. Although variant variety is a major driver for complexity of SCNs especially regarding mechatronic products, both topics are currently viewed independently within the field of complexity research. This paper is motivated by the case study of the SCNs of the production of gas-insulated switchgears (GIS). The GIS are produced in a modular and customized way worldwide. In order to minimize increasing production costs resulting from the modularization, the company is developing a globally distributed SCN. In this SCN, standard modules are prefabricated in low-wage countries. The subsequent variant creation takes place in European plants. The final customization can be completed by adjustments during commissioning. Customer requirements lead accordingly to a dynamic SCN, in which both the participating value-adding partners and the relationships within the network change. The dynamics, the diverse relationships and the numerous actors create a high degree of complexity with a reduced added-value transparency. This paper contributes a detailed literature analysis and illustrates the research needs of a holistic approach of complexity assessment for the development of product variants and their SCNs. As a result, a holistic approach for the assessment of both, product variants and SCNs, is developed. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to reduce the failure rate of GIS, the damage causes of basin-type insulator are analyzed, and the common detection methods for its defects are compared. The ultrasonic guided wave technology is used to detect and locate the internal bubbles, external attachments and cracks of basin-type insulator. Moreover, the propagation characteristics of Lamb wave in basin-type insulator are analyzed. The dispersion curve is drawn, and the frequency of excitation signal is determined. Meanwhile, the detection and location for defects of basin-type insulator are studied by finite element simulation and detection tests. The results show that the Lamb wave is excited by the piezoelectric probe with a resonant frequency of 100 kHz in the basin-type insulator, and it is received by the piezoelectric probe array.

To connect the conductors with other parts of the system, separable connections with contact elements are the common and most used solution. In many cases, the separable connections can be replaced with permanent connections in order to reduce costs, operating power losses and increase the reliability, especially if short circuit currents occur. To set up these permanent connections, technologies like the press- and shrink-fit are investigated. Based on the preliminary investigations presented in 2015 a broad variety of connections were established with different interferences, grooved and knurled as well as silver-plated contact surfaces to allow for statistic evaluations. The contact and long-term behavior of the connections are investigated with oven-experiments as well as under current load for a period of more than 10,000 h. Mechanical finite element models of the press- and shrink-fit connections are set up to investigate the resulting contact force as well as the mechanical stress distribution in the contact area.

Existing data forwarding strategies in mobile social networks rely on the pairwise contacts among mobile users. However, these pairwise contacts only provide limited forwarding capabilities and most data fail to be delivered before the expiration time. In this paper, we improve the performance of data forwarding by proactively placing low-cost static relays to increase the opportunistic contacts among the mobile nodes. Based on this idea, an important question is where to place the static relays in the network to best facilitate data forwarding among nodes. To answer this question, we first analyze four real-world datasets of mobile social networks, and identify that data forwarding only appears in a small group of social links. Then, we formalize the problem of static relay placement as an optimization problem, and propose a heuristic based solution to improve the data forwarding performance along these social links. Considering the fact that the social links may evolve over time, we also propose an efficient relay replacement algorithm which replaces the outdated relays with new relays to further improve the data forwarding performance. Evaluation results show that the proposed relay based solutions can significantly improve the performance of data forwarding in mobile social networks. © 1967-2012 IEEE."

Therefore, it is highly expected to assess the environmental impact and optimize the design at global and local levels. Exergoenvironmental analysis is a valid approach to investigate the formation of environmental impacts (EIs) associated with energy conversion systems at the component level. It generates information crucial for designing systems with a lower overall environmental impact, based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and exergy analysis. A 600 MW supercritical coal-fired system with and without dust, SO2 and NOx mitigation controls was analyzed. Heat transfer in the boiler, condenser(CND), low pressure cylinder(LP), air preheater(APH) show high potential to decrease the environmental impact due to high exergy destructions. The deaerator (DEA), induced draft fan(IDF), forced draft fan(FDF) should be focussed on construction design and manufacturing optimization.

A pressure rise calculation method based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been put forward in this paper. The pressure rise was calculated and the arc tests between the copper electrodes were performed in the container under different gap lengths by the current source. The results show that the calculated pressure rise agrees well with the measurement, and the relative error of the average pressure rise is about 2%. Arc volume has less effect on the pressure distribution in the container. Arc voltage Root-Mean-Square (RMS) has significant randomness with the change of arc current, and increases with the increase of gap length. The average arc voltage gradients measure at about 26, 20 and 16 V/cm when the gap lengths are 5, 10 and 15 cm, respectively. The proportion (thermal transfer coefficient kp) of the arc energy leading to the pressure rise in the container is about 44.9%. The pressure is symmetrically distributed in the container before the pressure wave reaches the walls and the process of the energy release is similar to an explosion. The maximum overpressure in the corner is increased under the reflection and superimposition effects of the pressure wave, but the pressure waves will be of no importance any longer than a few milliseconds in the closed container. © 2017 by the authors.

It was observed that the oxide thickness at the crack tip tended to increase with decreasing cyclic loading frequency. The crack path was a mix of transgranular and intergranular fractures. According to the grain reference orientation deviation (GROD) maps, it was revealed that the density of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) in the matrix along the crack path and ahead of crack tip increased with an increase in the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) due to environmental effects. It was observed that (1) mobile dislocations at the crack surface were blocked due to the thick oxide layer, resulting in an increase in the density of GNDs, and (2) an increase in the density of GNDs might induce stress concentration at the crack tip, deformation twinning, and the acceleration of FCGRs.

Different types of OCAES viz. - Diabatic, adiabatic and isothermal are possible based on the handling of heat in the system. In diabatic OCAES, compressed air is cooled in a cooler and heated using external heat source before transport to the expander. In Adiabatic OCAES, heat from the compressed air is stored in a thermal energy storage (TES) and reused to reheat compressed air before sending it to the expander. In Isothermal OCAES, air is compressed and expanded isothermally which results in the least compression work and highest expansion work. These OCAES configurations are assessed using exergy analysis in this paper. The exergy efficiency of individual components, exergy flow and overall efficiencies of diabatic, adiabatic and isothermal OCAES are presented.

Due to the rapid rise of DC current under DC line fault, DC circuit breaker with high speed and large capacity is generally used to isolate DC faults in the VSC-HVDC engineering. However, the manufacture of DC circuit breaker is difficult and costly, hindering the development of the DC power grid. So, the VSC-HVDC transmission grid based on hybrid MMC and fast vacuum switch is proposed. It makes full use of the control ability of hybrid MMC, proposing an active current limiting control strategy. The VSC-HVDC transmission grid can be switched to a new steady state quickly and flexibly. The power interruption time of the DC grid is shortened, which can improve the utilization of the DC grid. At the same time, the fast vacuum switches are installed in the DC line to replace the high-speed large-capacity DC circuit breaker, to reduce the construction cost of the DC power grid.

274,Chen C.; Zhong X.; Xiao J.; Zhu Y.; Jiang J.,Performance monitoring of regenerative system based on dominant factor method,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","Safe and efficient operation of a power plant is the system designers' target. Regenerative system improves the Rankine Cycle efficiency of a power station. However, it is quite difficult to monitor the regenerative system's performance in an accurate, economical and real-time way at any operation load. There are two main problems about this. One is that most model based on numerical and statistics approaches cannot be explained by the actual operation mechanism of the actual process. The other is that most mechanism models in the past could not be used to monitor the system performance accurately at real-time. This paper focuses on solving these two problems and finds a better way to monitor the regenerative system's performance accurately in a real-time by the analysis of the mechanism models and numerical methods. It is called the dominant factor method. Two important parameters (characteristic parameter and dominant factor) and characteristic functions are introduced in this paper. Also, this paper described the analysis process and the model building process. In the paper, the mathematics model building process is based on a 1000MW unit's regenerative system. Characteristic functions are built based on the specific operating data of the power unit. Combing the general mechanism model and the characteristic function together, this paper builds up a regenerative system off-design mathematical model. First, this paper proved the model accuracy by computer simulation. Then, the models were used to predict the pressure of the piping outlet, the temperature of the outlet feedwater and drain water of heaters in a real-time by computers. The results show that the deviation rate between the theoretical predictions and the actual operation data is less than 0.25% during the whole operation load range. At last, in order to test the fault identification ability of this model, some real tests were done in this 1000MW power plant during the actual operation period. The performance changes are identified via the difference between the predict value and the real time value. The result of the tests shows that the performance's gradient change and sudden change could be found by the model result easily. In order to verify the adaptability of the model, it was used for another 300MW unit, and done some operation test. The results show that this method can also be used for the 300MW unit's regenerative system. And it can help the operator to recognize the fault heater. The results of this paper proved that the dominant factor method is feasible for performance monitoring of the regenerative system. It can be used to monitor and find the fault of the regenerative system at any operation load by an accurate and fast way in real-time. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

Effective assessment of loss exposure or risk related to gas turbines has become and will continue to be a critical but challenging task for property insurers and their clients. Such systematic gas turbine risk assessment is a necessary step to develop strategies for turbine risk mitigation and loss prevention. This paper presents a study of outage data from the Generating Availability Data System (GADS) by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The risk of forced outages in turbines was evaluated in terms of outage days and number of outages per unit-year. In order to understand the drivers of the forced outages, the influence of variables including turbine age, capacity, type, loading characteristic, and event cause codes were analyzed by grouping the outage events based on the chosen values (or ranges of values) of these variables.

The use of high-efficiency alternative systems is becoming progressively more interesting due to economic reasons and regional incentives. The issue of finding the best configuration that minimizes total annual cost is not enough anymore, as the environmental concern has become one of the objectives in the synthesis of energy systems. The minimization of costs is often contradictory to the minimization of environmental impact. Multi-objective optimization tackles the conflicting objectives issue by providing a set of trade-off solutions, or Pareto solutions, that can be examined by the decision maker in order to choose the best configuration for the given scenario. The present work proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for the synthesis of a trigeneration system that must attend the electricity, heat, and cooling demands of a multifamily building complex in Zaragoza, Spain. The objective functions to be minimized are the overall annual costs and the overall annual CO2 emissions, considering investment, maintenance and operation costs. As a first approach, the single-objective configurations for each objective function are evaluated. Then, the Pareto frontier is obtained for the minimization of total annual costs and total annual CO2 emissions, allowing to obtain the best trade-off configuration, which brings results close to the optimal single objectives. It is worth mentioning that the treatment of the energy prices was simplified in order to keep on the same level of detail as energy CO2 emissions, which are given only on an annual basis. On the other hand, the optimization model developed can be further complicated in order to consider more complex situations. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

It has been successfully established in medium-voltage switchgear for decades. The introduction of a 145 kV climate-neutral gas-insulated switchgear as well as a climate-neutral 145 kV circuit breaker based on vacuum interrupter units and clean air as insulating medium reveals the application of the vacuum technology for future climate-neutral switchgear. The next step in this development process addresses a vacuum interrupter unit for 170 kV CO2-neutral switchgear. Thus, in this contribution the world's first single-breaking vacuum interrupter unit with 170 kV rated voltage and 50 kA rated short-circuit interruption current is presented. The dielectric performances of the vacuum interrupter unit and of the contact design are significantly improved as compared to existing 145 kV solutions. The realized conception of the contact system comprises the shape of the contact components, a significant reduction of the accelerated mass of the contact system, and a well-defined control of the contact travel curve of the driving mechanism enabling maximum short-circuit switching performance. The inner and the outer dielectric design of the vacuum interrupter unit are optimized to achieve a more compact switching tube that meets the requirements of future climate-neutral gas insulated switchgear. For this purpose, the dielectric design of the vapor shields inside the vacuum tube and of the ceramic insulators is optimized. This leads to a significant reduction of the total ceramic length.

But few clean emissions power technologies can operate 24/7. Concentrated solar power (CSP) can because it can store thermal energy at 10-20% of the cost of batteries1 and can then burn fuel when its solar resource is exhausted. However, many see first generation CSP as too costly, complex, risky, and economical only at utility scale. Alternatively, by mimicking the all-factory, standardized, modular approach of wind and PV, next generation CSP with low-cost dry thermal storage (e.g., firebrick, not molten salts), and using no water/steam (just hot air) may give CSP the potential to fulfill on its promise of baseload affordability. This technical paper summarizes an Engineering and Cost Feasibility Study2 funded by the US Department of Energy as well as presents a new breakthrough power generation product based on the Brayton power tower system called 247Solar Plants™. Design, construction, and operation are all simplified with greatly reduced costs and increased deployment speeds. Such modular CSP systems can be installed as single units or 100s of modules at utility scale. The microturbines used by the system stabilize grids by responding nearly instantly, similar to battery response time, to changing power demands and voltage fluctuations, while offering dispatchable, reliable electricity. The redundancy of multiple modules in a single project increases capacity factor, operational flexibility, and project reliability. The DOE Study shows that such a system may be able to achieve the two key DOE targets included: 1) a capacity factor of at least 75%, of which >85% would be solar with <15% from fuels; and LCOE3s <9¢/kWh.

Consequently, internal short-circuit arcing tests in a closed container were carried out under different gap lengths by a series circuit of inductance (L) and capacitance (C). The arcing characteristics and the change of pressure rise in the closed container were analyzed through the measurement data, such as current, arc voltage, and pressure rise. The results show that the fluctuations of the arc voltage are intensified with the increase of pressure in the closer container. Arc voltage Root-Mean-Square (RMS) has significant randomness with the change of arc current, and increases with the adding of gap length. Arc resistance decreases with the increase of arc current, and the arc resistance per unit gap length is about 6 mΩ/cm. The pressure rise increases with the growth of arc energy, and both show a good relation with linear function. The ratio (kp) of the energy leading to pressure rise on the arc energy is about 45% and the gap length has less influence, and kp decreases with the increase of arc energy and gradually tends to stabilize. © 2019, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Status information is generated through each of the switchgear units. The information includes the status of the power devices or terminals installed inside the switchgear. The status information of the switchboard is data based and encrypted for each power device in the switchboard. Based on this, the integrated management system of the switchboard is provided. Methods/Statistical analysis: Switchboards are widely used throughout industrial facilities. Because of the large impact caused in the event of an accident, this is used to configure the system to prevent accidents. The switchboard system should be monitored at all times. Because it can cause not only accidents such as breakage, explosion, fire of electric equipment, but also it can be extended to loads connected to the system, such as schools, buildings, apartment complexes and factories if it is broken. By monitoring the load in real time using the switchboard monitoring module, you can check the part where the deterioration has progressed by using the thermal camera beforehand. Findings: We propose diagnostic contents using thermal imaging camera in order to prevent accidents that may occur in this paper.

But a large methodological error limits the possibility of their use, especially when rationing low resistances. The article shows the possibility to improve the accuracy of electrodeless measurement methods using commercially available measuring instruments. In electrical installations of telecommunication networks of buildings, structures and industrial enterprises, the form of the AC voltage signal of the industrial supply network (~220V, 50/60Hz) can be differ greatly from the sinusoidal for short periods of time. The causes of distortions are usually associated with a sudden change in the network load [1], for example, when you turn on a powerful electric motor, furnace, welding machine, etc. The occurrence of impulse overvoltages and interference caused by electromagnetic effects (lightning, switching, radio frequency and others) on low-voltage networks, not only leads to failure of electrical installations, cables, switchboards, but also to damage the terminal equipment and malfunction. This is due, primarily, to the saturation of modern buildings and structures with information, telecommunications and other digital equipment, which has a very low level of protection against impulse overvoltages and interference. All this makes it necessary to carry out appropriate protective measures. To reduce interference, it is necessary to perform a separate (working) ground loop, the resistance of which must be measured and periodically monitored. There are devices that allow an electrodeless method to monitor and evaluate the resistance of the ground loop. But these devices have a greater measurement error than devices that measure the resistance of the earth electrode method. The article deals with existing instruments (CA6410, MZC-303E) which can evaluate the resistance of the earth electrode and the possibility of increasing the accuracy of the measurement with the help of special current clamps is shown. Using a predetermined value of neutral impedance, the measurement error of the calculated resistance of the earthing switch can be determined with great accuracy. © 2018 Authors."

Often referred to as power control rooms (PCR), power distribution centers (PDC), or simply substations, these enclosures host the equipment that distributes, controls, and monitors the electrical power used for process equipment in the plant. Depending on the application, these enclosures typically contain low voltage or medium voltage switchgear and motor control centers. Often a battery room is included to provide DC power for switchgear control or for uninterrupted power systems (UPS) to ensure power supply in cases of standby or emergency. Although these enclosures are not continuously occupied by personnel during typical plant operations, industry design practices indicate that they be protected against potential explosions due to their critical function in the plant during an emergency. ASCE Design of Blast-Resistant Buildings for Petrochemical Facilities (2010) states that critical equipment must be protected to enable safe shutdown and must be designed for low response. Similarly, Process Industry Practice (PIP) Blast Resistant Building Design Criteria (2014) indicates that main electrical stations are classified as ""critical/essential"" and are to be designed for low response. These design practice documents, however, are limited to specifying ductility and end rotation for structural components of the enclosure, which may not be directly related to the functionality of equipment after the blast event. The paper discusses a real case of electrical enclosure that was subject to vapor cloud explosion loading during the Texas City accident in 2005. The paper illustrates the blast response of typical construction details of electrical enclosures such as cable wall penetrations, elevated floor, air conditioning duct penetrations, rear-access equipment doors, and interior non-structural items such as lights and cable trays.

In our experience, there are additional risks associated with supply chains and limited availability and understanding of damage mechanisms and reliability data of the myriad manufacturers and models of turbines, blade design and associated equipment. Failure of different components results in different outage times and therefore impact operational and maintenance (O&M) costs in different ways. Achieving high availability targets requires a robust O&M plan. The authors will highlight operational risks of large wind turbines and methodologies to improve reliability and availability for wind farms. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The work products of a valuation are sets of calculated metrics. Application areas include valuations of electric power and building energy systems. Uncertainty can manifest while exercising a valuation in the form of natural variability, lack of knowledge, and random events. In the context of the valuation process, risk is the combination of these sources of uncertainty and their consequences.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel MobileNets convolutional neural network (MCNN) model to identify the GIS PD patterns. We first construct the PD pattern recognition classification datasets by means of experiments and FDTD simulation, and also preprocess images via binarization processing. After constructing the MCNN model, depthwise separable convolutions and an inverse residual structure are adopted to deal with the vanishing gradient of the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in the GIS PD pattern recognition process. Then, through the graphics standardization process, the MCNN model is trained and tested. The whole training process is visualized by Tensorboard. Compared with other deep learning models and traditional machine learning methods, MCNN particularly stands out in recognition accuracy and time consumption with a 96.5% overall recognition rate and merely 7.3 seconds in training time. This research explores how to optimize the model by improving the recognition accuracy, and by reducing its computing load, storage space and energy consumption for better incorporation into intelligent terminals in the UPIoT context. © 2013 IEEE."
301,Neumann A.P.; Mulroy M.J.; Ebden C.,The use of 66kV technology for offshore wind demonstration sites,2014,IET Conference Publications,"Near-to-shore wind farms, such as the UK's Round 1, connect their generation to shore at 33kV. This is also currently the standard distribution voltage (or collection voltage) for inter-array networks. Larger, further-from-shore wind farms normally use offshore substations to step-up generation to a higher voltage, e.g. 132kV/170kV before transmission back to shore. Recent research shows that a submarine cable capable of being used for 66kV networks, i.e. a ""wet-type"" cable, could be type-tested and made available. The Carbon Trust is currently progressing work to qualify and type-test this cable, which presents opportunities for standard collection voltages to increase from 33kV to 66kV. This paper presents the benefits of utilising 66kV for near-shore and medium distance offshore wind farms, both for UK and international demonstration wind farm projects. The benefits include the potential to reduce the amount of submarine cabling required, reduced losses in the connection at 66kV versus 33kV, and the potential to eliminate offshore substations in some cases. The costs and benefits have been quantitatively and qualitatively assessed and detail is provided for 33kV/66kV equipment cost comparisons (switchgear, cable and transformers), cost reduction/benefit impacts of substation and cabling rationalisation, and full-life difference in losses and hence revenue from generation. The paper specifically addresses the feasibility of developing a system implementing 66kV at the Blyth Offshore Demonstration site. Also presented are potential enablers and barriers to 66kV market uptake such as supply chain readiness, the feasibility of demonstrating the proposed 66kV technology at dedicated sites in the UK and outline design and feasibility considerations for certification at 66kV with an emphasis on Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) certification. It is concluded that moving to 66kV could lead to capital cost and full-life benefits compared with the present standard voltage of 33kV for many near and medium distance-to-shore wind farms. However, steps to accelerate market uptake should also be considered by exploring enablers (testing, demonstration, certification, etc.) and solutions to related barriers."

However, the poor thermal properties of air requires better thermal designs to keep the temperature rise within the allowable industry limits to avoid premature switch degradation. This publication focuses on the temperature rise of load break switches (LBS) of different designs. A LBS with flexible braid was found to have considerably higher temperature rise than a design with the sliding contact. The study has shown that a stripped switch (with only the current path) can be used together with empirical determined heat transfer coefficients in a first approach for predicting the temperature rise of the critical parts of the LBS.

Whereas the past units being designed in base load now have to take part in peak load, and usually in a low load operation, unable to play its advantages of high efficiency in design load. In the article the current three main governing methods(i.e. nozzle governing, throttling governing and bypass governing) for steam turbine will be discussed and evaluated under economical criteria focused on the above described challenges for future power generating technologies. A new governing method is Nozzle governing with Overload Valve Regulation, which keeps the advantage that main steam pressure of the Nozzle governing steam turbine is higher under partial load conditions, and weakens the influence of the low efficiency of governing stage on high pressure turbine, effectively improves the efficiency of steam turbine unit under partial load conditions. In the turbine adopted the new governing method of Nozzle governing with Overload Valve Regulation, the first stage is governing stage, divided into several groups. Main steam from boiler goes through the main stop valve and main steam control valve in sequence, and then turns to the governing stage. When the load is below 85%THA, main steam control valve I?II and III are fully opened, main steam control valve IV is fully closed, and the unit is in sliding pressure operation. When the load is 85%THA, the main steam pressure can reach the rated pressure. With the load increasing, main steam control valve IV starts to open, but the main steam pressure maintains the rated pressure, adjusted to THA when main steam control valve IV is fully opened and the flowrate of governing stage reaches the maximum. In the load more than THA condition, the bypass valve starts to open, the main steam goes through the bypass steam room into the certain stage(as fourth), to meet the requirements of the super load, adjusted to VWO(about 108%THA) when the bypass valve is fully opened. Through the detailed description about the scheme set and calculation analysis about economy benefit of the new regulation technology of Nozzle governing with Overload Valve Regulation, it shows that with the annual load range of 40%THA-85%THA, the economy of turbine adopted the new regulation technology is better than bypass governing by about 21.6 kJ/kW.h.(CSPE) Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers became scarce and expensive. The maintenance activities in severe and extremely hot middle-east weather conditions were cumbersome and time consuming. A planned plant expansion with considerable incremental load to the facility provided an opportunity for a review of the complete electrical system. After a thorough review, it was decided to convert the main outdoor AIS to an indoor gas insulated switchgear (GIS) substation to support the existing and new facilities. However, a total loss of power to the continuous operation of this critical gas facility was unacceptable. The existing switchyard with an energized 230kV open bus system had limited space to safely perform the demolition and construction activities for the new GIS. Detailed analysis of the installation options, construction techniques, safety requirements and logistical methods was performed to eliminate potential for any total loss of power. The construction activity involved interfacing with two separate redundant power supply sources, with separate transmission line protection systems and equipment. The parties involved worked together in reaching an agreement on engineering, procurement, installation, testing and commissioning activities that would successfully implement this transition without any loss of power to the gas production facilities. © 2016 IEEE."

Direct drive electric generators offer both benefits; however, it is difficult to generate the required torque at the low speeds typical of these resources. In this DOE sponsored project, ABB US Corporate Research partnered with Resolute Marine Energy (RME) and Texas A&M University to investigate the suitability of direct drive electric power generation for a paddle-type wave energy converter (WEC). This WEC provides high torque in a relatively chaotic, oscillating manner and requires a machine capable of handling high peak torques of approximately 40, 000 N·m at speeds typically not exceeding 3 rpm. The baseline concept uses a hydraulic power take-off coupled with a generator and convertor; a direct drive electric solution may be beneficial. As a first step in designing a suitable direct drive generator for this application, we have begun with a smaller scale prototype targeting one tenth of the speed and torque, and we investigated a machine topology that may be promising in the operating regime of the full-scale machine. To this end, we designed and tested an integral generator and magnetic gear which is rated at 3, 800 N·m at 30 rpm and completed a paper design for a machine of the required scale.

Fluid properties were obtained using NIST REFPROP. Various working fluids were tested, including pentane (R601), isopentane (R601a), butane (R600), isobutane (R600a), butene, and cis-butene. Pentane and isopentane have not been of focus for SORCS at these temperatures. Varying turbine inlet temperatures ranging from 170 to 240°C were tested with the heat source provided by a medium temperature geothermal reservoir. A parametric analysis was performed on varying inlet pressure and turbine inlet temperature in comparison to first law efficiency, second law efficiency, effectiveness, and net work produced to analyze the overall and exergetic performance of each fluid. Optimum first law efficiency ranged from 17 to 22%. Cis-butene and pentane performed the best in all performance factors analyzed. Pentane and isopentane performed the best at pressures near or below their critical point. It was also found that near the critical temperature, a subcritical ORC has better performance than an SORC.

In the power system, especially nuclear power plants, as thermal stratification characteristic of nonuniform temperature distribution in the pipe and thermal fatigue such as the low cycle thermal fatigue due to existence of the cycle thermal stress are inevitable, the pipe line system can be destroyed easily and thus affect the normal operation of the power plants. In order to study the pipeline thermal fatigue, the pipeline thermal stress needs to be calculated and therefore the temperature distributions especially the inner wall temperature was needed. The outer wall temperature and working fluid temperature can be obtained with installing measuring tools. The key and difficult point is the estimation of the inner temperature distribution of the pipe. At the same time, in the practical engineering, the pipeline structure with special safety requirements or higher requirements for structural completeness are not allowed to be destroyed by the measuring equipment. Based on the consideration above, this paper presents a method of solving the inverse heat conduction problem, which means the inner temperature distributions can be derived by the outer wall temperature distributions. For the pipe inverse heat conduction problem, this paper applies numerical analysis as the main way. Firstly, the method for transient inverse heat conduction problems applying separation of variables and Duhamel's theorem is established. As the effects of the random error on the measured outer wall temperature are inevitable, the measured data need to be smoothed before used as an input. The Gram orthogonal polynomial method based on the digital filtering theory is applied in this paper to accomplish the smoothing process. The inverse process is accomplished by using MATLAB programming. Then this method is verified in the experiment with high temperature and high pressure. In order to directly validate the accuracy of the inverse analysis, for the test section, not only the transient outer wall temperature and fluid temperature were measured, but also the time dependent middle layer temperature were measured. Then the middle layer temperature obtained from inverse calculation was compared with the measured data from the experiment. The calculated results show that the accuracy of this method is high. The temperature distributions along the radical direction can be obtained quickly and accurate instantaneous heat load for the structural stress analysis and thermal fatigue analysis can be provided using this method.

Normal load, which directly affects contact stiffness between interfaces, is chosen as the mistuning parameter. Based on Mindlin model, a forced response analysis of the finite element model of mistuned bladed disk with damped shrouds is performed in ANSYS. Compared with results of other simplified models, a real and complicated nonlinear behavior are observed here. A mass of qualitative analysis is also performed to assess the impact of the mistuning magnitude and excitation level on the vibration. The result shows that, vibration response of bladed disk is affected by excitation and mistuning level significantly. Local amplification coefficient of vibration response in the cases of different mistuning levels is obtained by introducing 10 random mistuned patterns. In addition, frequency splitting phenomena even appears at one of the blades by the contribution of high mistuning levels. According to the calculated results for different excitation levels, the curve of modal damping varying with response amplitude is gained. Lastly, rigidity mistuning is introduced and a combined analysis is performed to investigate the influence of friction damping mistuning on rigidity mistuning in the same 10 random mistuning patterns. The arrangement of dry friction damping mistuning also could be controlled to reduce the local vibration amplification originating from structure mistuning. However, further statistical investigations should be made to gain more information. (CSPE) Copyright © 2017 ASME."

This was followed a month later by a flood that completely filled the building that houses WCPPs 1 and 2, submerging six large synchronous motors, pumps, and related electrical distribution equipment. These nearly simultaneous catastrophic events dramatically expanded and redefined the scope of the planned work. An immediate priority was to rebuild the electrical substation within 12 months so that the district could restore power to the undamaged WCPP 3 to meet the anticipated summer pumping demands. A longer-term priority was to completely rebuild the pumps and motors and replace the station service motor control centers (MCCs); switchgear lineups; controls; and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system at WCPPs 1 and 2 within the next 24 months.

Temperature rise of inner windings not only depends on the transformer loss, but relates to oil flow closely. Therefore, whether the oil flow of transformer and oil flow distribution rules among the three windings can be predicted or not, relates to success or failure of the winding temperature rise research. According to the structural characteristics of transformer, a three-dimensional computational model including windings and external radiators was built by a three-dimensional modeling software. Initially, from the view of flow, the flow resistance of natural oil circulation power transformer windings has been calculated and analyzed using the CFD methodology, and the resistance characteristic curves about high voltage windings, middle voltage windings, low voltage windings, radiators and pipelines were fitted respectively by the least square method. And then, on the basis of above, the porous media model was applied to simplify the integral model of transformer so as to build a three-dimensional coupled porous media-pure fluid computational model. Meanwhile, the author calculated porosities and linear resistance coefficients of high voltage, middle voltage and low voltage windings. At the end of this paper, to obtain the relationship of oil flow distribution among three windings, the pressure loss was calculated by numerical simulation. Compared with the theoretical calculation results which was based on the part of experimental data, the numerical calculation results are in agreement with these data. And the error between them is within 6 percent. Therefore, the feasibility and accuracy of calculation method, which was used to calculate oil flow of natural oil circulation power transformer windings by the porous media model, has been verified as well. There are two kinds of conventional method to calculate oil flow, including an empirical method and an experimental method. On the one hand, although the former kind of method can be applied conveniently, it cannot consider all the factors so that the accuracy cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, experimental method to calculate the flow can present high accuracy, but the cost of carrying out experimental study is high. Therefore, this paper presents another calculation method aimed to the flow resistance and oil flow by CFD. And the calculation method presented has higher calculation accuracy compared to above. Meanwhile, the new method provides a theoretical reference about oil flow distribution for the design of the power transformer. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

Unfortunately, past observations have shown that the switchboard cabinet and its contents may be vulnerable to damage or failure during an earthquake. An electrical switchboard cabinet is a complex structure typically constructed using cold-formed steel frame members enclosed by steel panels and containing a variety of switchgear and bus bars. The panels are usually fastened to the steel members by screws, and the steel members are connected together by bolts or screws. The structural behavior of the cabinet can be evaluated using shake table testing and/or high fidelity finite element models. However, these methods are relatively expensive, highly specific, and interpretation of the results may be difficult. Therefore, a method to formulate a simplified finite element model for the cabinet is proposed in this study. The simplified model consists of beam elements (Timoshenko), shell elements and springs. This model can be constructed and executed computationally at a lower cost, and interpretation of the results is a simpler assignment. The present model has the capability to capture the effect of warping deformation in the frame members and possible nonlinear behaviors of the cabinet, such as: local buckling at the end of frame members due to high bending moments, failure of the screw connections and buckling of the panels. The simplified model is validated using a high fidelity model of the cabinet under 1st-order and 2nd-order pushover analyses. Future work to incorporate structural models for the internal components is also discussed."

Detailed performance of key component such as reformer, fuel cell and gas turbine of the hybrid system was studied under different biomass gas fuel compositions and steam/carbon ([S] /[C] ) ratios. The results show that the hybrid system can reach the efficiency of 59.24% under the designed working condition. The biomass gas from different sources and processes usually have varied fuel concentrations, especially for methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O), which could significantly affect the performance of hybrid system. Results show that the change of H2 proportion has the most significant influence to system output power, CO and CH4 have similar influence trend. System electrical efficiency increases slightly with the change of H2 proportion while decreasing significantly with the increase of CO and CH4 proportion. The increasing composition of CH4, H2 and CO in biomass gas fuel benefits the output power of hybrid system, but results in the higher risk of overheat as well, which might cause safety problems. The composition of water in biomass gas affects the [S] /[C] ratio of system, and results show that maintaining the [S] /[C] ratio at a certain level can guarantee the temperature of key components in the hybrid system below the limits, which can satisfy the safety standards. The results show this technology has a good application prospect. (CSPE) Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The gas turbine system was provided with the concentrated solar light from the dish reflector at the solar receiver and the combustion heat from the biomass synthesis gas at the thermal receiver. Numerical model was developed to the solar receiver and the thermal receiver to reveal their thermal potential. The solar receiver was a close loop concentric annuli to receive highly condensed solar light of 1, 000kW/m2. The inner cylinder was made of high-temperature resistance ceramic irradiated by the condensed light on the inner side. The liner was inserted between the inner cylinder and the outer shell. The pressurized air passes the many holes of the liner to impinge the outer surface of the irradiation wall. These impinging jets caused high heat transfer coefficient on the irradiation wall and alleviates the thermal distribution in the receiver aisle. The liner and the outer shell were made by the high temperature resistance INCONEL alloy. The thermal receiver was also a close loop annuli. This uses the same part as the solar receiver and the biomass gas combustor combined to it. The combustor comprises of the liner and the center tube, installed to the inside of the ceramic cylinder. The biomass gas was provided to the gap between liner and the center tube, and the oxidant air to the outer side of the liner. The biomass gas was spouted from the many holes of the liner and mixed with the oxidant air. The resulted hot combustion gas impinged directly to the inner side of the ceramic cylinder. The impingement of the hot combustion gas thinned the thermal boundary layer and enhanced the heat transfer on the ceramic wall. The thermal receiver was designed to attain the preferable heat transfer performance by the inner impinging jet of the hot combustion gas as well as the outer impinging jet of the pressurized air. Three dimensional numerical model was developed to the solar receiver and the thermal receiver considered in the present study using ANSYS FLUENT. Parameter study showed that the exit air from the solar receiver was heated above 1200K or higher presently, and was continued to search better condition and better configuration of the system to obtain higher temperature. The numerical simulation revealed that the distance from the jet nozzle (linear holes) and the heat transfer surface is critical to the thermal distribution. The concept of the new solar and thermal receivers was confirmed on their usefulness; the multiple impinging jet effectively enhanced the heat transfer on the ceramic wall of the solar receiver and the thermal receiver to reduce the thermal inhomogeneity near the heat transfer surface with pressure loss of order 800Pa.

322,Catlett R.; Martin D.; Wilson R.A.,Improving relay protection levels in medium-voltage switchgear,2014,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,"This paper demonstrates the impacts of an electronically triggered fault current limiter (ET-FCL) on typical single-ended and main-tie-main (MTM) medium-voltage switchgear arrangements. The fast acting (less than 1 ms) ET-FCL described in this paper effectively opens the normally closed tie connection between two mains, thereby disconnecting one of the sources to the fault. An ultrafast opening of the tie connection simplifies protection coordination by not having to coordinate the main breaker relay with the tie breaker relay at maximum fault levels. System benefits include the following: significantly lower arc flash energy for downstream faults, faster backup clearing times for a feeder relay/breaker failure, reduction of motor starter dropouts due to fault-produced voltage dips, improved system stability, improvement in utility's CAIDI reliability index, reduced stress on switchgear breakers, and overall lower capital costs on new construction (switchgear, cables, etc.). This paper demonstrates relay setting changes on typical single-ended and MTM arrangement with and without applying the ET-FCL. Impacts on incident energy reduction, backup clearing times, dynamic system stability, and voltage dips will be discussed. © 2014 IEEE."
323,Cai Y.; Li W.; Zhang B.; Wu W.; Sheng D.; Chen J.,Reliable analysis on fast valving of ultra-supercritical unit under transient fault conditions,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","Fast valving of ultra-supercritical unit has great effects on over-speed prevention, load-shedding control, transient stability analysis of electrical system and other security problems. The purpose of fast valving is to maintain the stability of power system once fault or load shedding of unit occurs in the electric power system. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the reliability of fast valving for ultra-supercritical unit. In this paper, the KU ( short shedding) logic condition of SIEMENS T3000 system is analyzed as the research object of fast valving. The unit can be avoided over speed by monitoring the unit load and fast valving under faulty grid conditions based on the KU control. A series of measures will be taken after KU is triggered, for instance the governing valving will be closed quickly and the DEH (digital electro-hydraulic) control of the steam turbine will be switched to speeding control mode. On the other hand, the unit will return to normal operation if the transient fault of power grid disappears. The key contributions of this thesis include three parts: Firstly, based on the analysis of control characteristics of ultra-supercritical unit and protective logic and triggered conditions of KU function, a novel dynamic model by coupling the fast valving of steam turbine and the transient stability of generator is established by applying the PSCAD software. Then, the dynamic response process of ultra-supercritical unit is simulated and calculated by adopting the coupling dynamic model when KU function is triggered. Also the influence factors and reliability of fast valving are analyzed under transient fault conditions. Finally, two optimized measures by increasing the time delay and the speed of quantitative judgment are put forward to reduce risks and avoid the misoperation of signal distortion which may be caused by the power transmitter under transient fault conditions. The results of this study can not only help to evaluate the reliability of fast valving function scientifically in power grid transient fault, but also guide the technicians to analyze the stability of the power grid.

324,Amadi-Echendu J.; Xulu N.,Condition assessment of civil engineering assets,2014,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,"The management of engineered assets like cooling tower structures constructed from reinforced concrete, and pipe racks fabricated in steel, generally receive less maintenance emphasis than plant equipment such as instrumentation, pumps, switch gear or vehicles. This seems more apparent in mining and mineral processing firms where production output is the dominant concern. Coupled with the usually longer life span of civil structures and static mechanical components, this tendency often leads to limited knowledge about the condition of assets like cooling towers, substation buildings, and pipe racks which, in principle, cannot run to failure. The paper is based on an ongoing case study of a large industrial complex. Three sources of data are being explored to provide insight regarding the condition assessment of engineering structures in practice. The perplexing initial findings suggest that despite advances in condition monitoring technologies, more often than not, visual inspection prevails as the assessment method and thus confines budget provisions for maintenance activities. © Springer-Verlag London 2014."

In twenty-first century, with the rapid development of installed capacity of 1000MW ultrasupercritical thermal generating units in China, at the end of 2015, there are eighty-three 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units which were put into operation in China, China has become the country which posses the most 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units in operation. In order to meet the high reliability requirements of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units which have been put into operation, the reliability design methods for a complete set of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units are needed in engineering. The calculation formula of the availability deducted planned outage hours from period hours and the reliability calculation models of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units were proposed, simultaneously with the calculation and compliance methods for the equivalent availability factor design value of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units. The statistical formulas of the reliability characteristic, statistical results for the unit derating factor of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units were given, together with the calculation examples and verification examples of equivalent availability factor design value for 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units. The relative error's range of the equivalent availability factor design values is between-0.55% to 3.37%, base on the statistical results for reliability of 123-year operation data of eighteen 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units in 8 thermal power stations. Among them, the absolute value of relative error's range of equivalent availability factor design values for 120 unit years operation data is less than 1%. Results shows that the calculation accuracy of the equivalent availability factor EAF of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units is high precision by using the reliability design methods are given. These reliability design methods may be using in quantitative calculation of the design value of equivalent availability factor, which therefore may serve as a reference for reliability design and improvement of 1000MW ultra-supercritical thermal generating units.

326,Gallego J.M.; Castro A.; Melero A.; Minguez S.,Impact of renewable grid code compliance on substation design,2016,CIGRE Session 46,"The impact of Grid Code on renewable energy projects shows a growing trend. As the participation of renewable sources on the overall energy mix increases, the severity and complexity of the requirements imposed on such renewable installations escalates accordingly. Grid Code compliance has an impact on all stages of a project, from the bid stage to the construction and commissioning, through all the design and engineering phase. The outcoming results of Grid Code compliance analysis may have an effect on several areas of the project, such as economics, planning, deadlines and layout. The purpose of this paper is to describe the impact of Grid Code requirements on the design of the substation associated to the renewable energy installation. The various impacts shall be analysed following the most usual requirements for renewable power plants, as seen in leading Grid Codes from countries such as the UK, Germany or South Africa. In general, the substation equipment shall be able to withstand the established frequency and voltage operation ranges. Additionally, voltage stability and system robustness requirements have the greatest impact on the substation design. The voltage range definition, reactive capability requirement, voltage control strategies, power quality limitations (harmonics, rapid voltage change) or fault ride through capability requirements lead in many situations to additional reactive compensation equipment or harmonic filtering equipment. These requirements define not only the type of additional equipment (discrete reactive regulation, such as a capacitor bank, continuous one, such as a Statcom or SVC, harmonic filtering provisions) but have an impact as well on many aspects of the substation design, brought by the addition of extra equipment of certain dimensions. To the immediate effect on costs, planning and procurement engineering shall be added the impacts on layout, civil engineering (e.g. foundations, cable trenches), switchgear design (e.g. number of bays), control engineering (e.g. number of signals, additional commands, logics, additional control cubicles), protection system design and pre-commissioning and commissioning process. Some of these requirements, such as the voltage range or the reactive capability requirement, have an impact also on the substation step-up transformers, especially on the definition of the on-load tap changer characteristics. The impact of system management requirements is observed mainly on the control and protection designs. It is usual for Grid Codes to establish guidelines regarding the correct behaviour and management of the system. Each Grid Code may require certain information and agreements relative to control schemes and settings and to electrical protections. In general, it may be said that protection design and settings shall not only ensure the correct and safe operation of the installation as a whole, but also allow the renewable power plant to comply with the requirements established by the applicable Grid Code, ensuring that no actuation of the relays prevent the fulfilment of said requirements. In summary, the impact of various types of requirements on particular aspects of the substation design shall be analysed. Even if the Grid Code compliance studies are developed alongside the engineering and procurement phases, it is important to properly understand these impacts from the early stages of the project, in order to avoid Grid Code compliance issues later on and to plan sufficiently for changes in scope, costs and planning. © 2016 CIGRE.

There are many sites where limited head and flow rate is available but these resources cannot be exploited due to inefficient technologies. Gravitational vortex turbine (GVT) is a novel technology that is suitable for microlevel power production where low head and flow rate is available. It consists of two main parts: vortex pool for vortex generation and turbine blades. This paper focuses on parametrical analysis of GVT to determine the geometrical characteristics which gives the best performance. These parameters would address; effect of velocity and symmetry of vortex with the ratio of upper diameter of funnel (D) to outlet diameter (d), effect of the angle of rectangular inlet passage on the vortex formation. It will also analyze flow in rectangular passage with constant cross section vs. converging cross section. All of these parameters have major impact on the velocity and symmetry of flow. Results show that outlet of the funnel should be 40% of the upper diameter while highest velocity was achieved when rectangular passage was at 60 degrees with pre-rotational plate at 30 degrees.

Gas turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) and turbine rotor blades deteriorate through a long-time operation due to various causes such as a particle attachment, erosion, and a thermal stress. In the present study, a numerical investigation has been carried out to clarify the influence of the NGV and the rotor blade deterioration on aerodynamics in a 3-stage gas turbine. Geometries of the NGV and the rotor blade were measured from a real gas turbine using a 3-D scanner. The first stage NGVs and rotor blades usually deteriorate seriously and are usually replaced at certain intervals. Two kinds of the geometries of the NGV and the rotor blade of the first stage were obtained, which are the new ones before use and the used ones to be replaced. For the second stage and the third stage, the geometries before use were used in the computations. The numerical results show that the isentropic efficiency of the first stage increases and that of the second stage decrease due to the deterioration of the first stage. The efficiency of the third stage is not affected significantly. The mechanisms are discussed from the observation of the flow fields. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

In these hybrid configurations, either multi effect desalination (MED) or thermal vapor compression (TVC)-MED unit is integrated to the Rankine cycle power block. The particular focus is on comparison between single plant and hybrid plants in terms of energy efficiency and penalty in power production to determine the more efficient configuration. The achieved results showed that integration of MED unit to the power cycle is thermodynamically more efficient, due to less reduction in power production and efficiency than the TVCMED configurations. Also, for hybrid solar tower-MED plat, the average penalty in power production was between 9.27% and 12.88% when fresh production increased from 10000 m3/day to 31, 665 m3/day. Another important finding showed the specific power consumption (specific power penalty) of the hybrid plant decreases with increasing the fresh water production. Especially at higher fresh water production, this specific power consumption was competitive to other desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis. The proposed hybrid solar tower-MED plant offers different benefits such as possibility of eliminating the cooling system requirement of the cycle as it can be replaced by the MED unit.

333,Chu C.C.-M.; Tie R.H.Y.; Rahman Md.M.,Simulation of effective plume-chimney above natural draft aircooled heat exchangers,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","Effective Plume-Chimney Height (EPCH) was a factor engineers used to design and analyse the performance of natural convection in air-cooled heat exchangers particularly in the event of power outage. To date the number of papers in the open literature presenting data on natural convection performance of air-cooled heat exchangers is scarce. The aim of this study is to corroborate the experimental results and theoretical predictions of Effective Plume-Chimney Height (EPCH) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a laboratory-scale air cooled heat exchanger of 457mm ×457mm face area and an industrial-scale test rig of 2.4m ×6.0m face area forced draft air-cooled heat exchanger comprising of a bundle with 4 rows of annular finned tubes in staggered formation operating under natural convection. The CFD software Phoenics 2015 was employed to simulate the electrically-heated air-cooled heat exchanger fitted with a top screen which was built to study the aerodynamics of natural convection of air-cooled heat exchangers. The CFD geometry arrangement and dimensions were schematic in nature, where errors introduced were considered reasonably negligible. The laboratory-scale exchanger model experimental pressure drop data was found to have an insignificant effective plumechimney height, as predicted by a theoretical equation. It was found that EPCH values calculated from CFD results agree closely to within -0.11m and +0.06m with both experiments and the theoretical prediction, confirming the same conclusion reached in an earlier report. However, for an industrial-scale test rig (ITR) in forced draft mode of large face dimensions the EPCH had been found to be non-negligible in an earlier work. Significant values of theoretical effective plume-chimney height were inserted in the heat transfer and pressure drop simulation that appeared to yield results that agreed with the experimental heat loads. The CFD simulations on the ITR have confirmed the existence of significant effective plume-chimney heights at more than 100 percent of the bundle depth, or the chimney height. The implication is that a solid-walled chimney can appear to have an efficiency of more than 100 per cent, if cold inflow can be prevented or the penetration to the central core hindered. Since the validation of the existence of EPCH by CFD here has used only a set of data from a single source, it is worthwhile to produce more experimental data and analysis to establish the concept for better predictions of air-cooled heat exchanger natural convection performance.

Fourteen Streckeisen STS-2 Broadband seismometers and two 3D sonic anemometers are deployed in/near an operating wind farm to collect the data used in these proof-of-principle analyses. The interquartile mean (IQM) value of power spectral density (PSD) of the seismic components in 10-minute time series are used to characterize the spectral signatures (i.e. frequencies with enhanced variance) in ground vibrations deriving from vibrations of wind turbine subassemblies. A power spectral envelope approach is taken in which the probability density function of seismic PSD is developed using seismic data collected under normal turbine operation. These power spectral envelopes clearly show the energy distribution of wind-turbine-induced ground vibrations over a wide frequency range. Singular PSD lying outside the power spectral envelopes can be easily identified, and are used herein along with SCADA data to diagnose the associated suboptimal turbine operating conditions. Illustrative examples are given herein for periods with yaw-misalignment and excess tower acceleration. It is additionally shown that there is a strong association between drivetrain acceleration and seismic spectral power in a frequency band of 2.5-12.5 Hz. The long-term goal of the research is development of seismic-based condition monitoring (SBCM) for wind turbines. The primary advantages of SBCM are that the approach is low-cost, non-invasive and versatile (i.e., one seismic sensor monitoring for multiple turbine subassemblies). Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The catalytic combustion is applied for RRTCC. The catalytic combustion characteristic of RRTCC is studied using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that when the inlet velocity is 20 m/s, the methane conversion rate is 90%∼95%, and the corresponding outlet gas temperature is 1030∼1200K. When there is a variation of ±25% in the inlet velocity, the variation of methane conversation rate is -15% and 5% respectively, and the variation of outlet gas temperature is - 6% and 2% respectively. Additionally, it is found that the hotspot temperature of combustor wall decreases with the increase of inlet velocity. The lowest value of hotspot temperature is about 1000K, which is higher than the ignition temperature of CH4. Therefore, the existence of hotspot temperature is useful for the catalytic ignition. The temperature distribution on the combustion side exhibits a smoking-pipelike shape, as well as the recuperative side. The results can provide data reference for RRTCC design.

Radiative properties of combustion gases and char oxidation in the oxy-fuel condition are obviously different from the air-fuel combustion, due to the N2 replaced by CO2. Through researchers proposed many helpful correlations based on the air-fuel Weighted-Sum-of-Grey- Gases-Model (WSGGM), the absorption coefficients were commonly constant or correlations were discrete by the classical molar ratio of H2O to CO2 (MR), which were mismatching the continuous value of MR in the real furnace. Meanwhile, the discrete MR is also not applied to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this paper, new correlations for the WSGGM are determined as polynomial function of MR and temperature, which can be conveniently employed in Fluent by the form of user-defined-functions in C language. Parameters of model are fitted by total emittances calculated based on the timely HITEMP 2010 database. New correlations are validated by comparing the emittances with line-by-line calculations and other classical models. New correlations are employed in the CFD for the real industrial oxy-fuel combustion with the temperature range of 400-2600K, pressure path-length between 0.01 and 60 bar m. Several assumed test cases have been investigated to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Modified correlations for WSGGM give a better accuracy of the total emittances for the mixed combustion gases in the real furnace. New models including radiative and chemical reaction mechanisms have been employed to CFD modeling of combustion process for a tangentially fired 300MWe utility boiler. The industrial boiler is modeled by a partition meshing method with the hexahedral structured mesh. Due to the atmosphere shift from N2 to CO2, three aspects are essential to be modified for oxy-fuel: radiation model, char oxidation model and homogeneous volatile oxidation model. To investigate the performance of the furnace, air-fuel combustion selected as the conference, three other cases employed are defined as Oxy21 (vol21%, O2), Oxy26 (vol26, O2) and Oxy29 (vol29%, O2), respectively. Temperature profile and heat transfer are investigated for the different test cases. Meanwhile, the simulation and calculation heat transfer in the furnace are also compared. The results show the new modified simulation has an approximate 4-11% lower than the thermodynamic calculation. To achieve an identical heat flux and temperature distributions with the air-fuel case, the molar fraction 29% of O2 is essential for the selected implementation. (CSPE) Copyright © 2017 ASME."

This paper selects double reheat cycle design for study and incorporates back pressure extraction steam turbine (BEST) into current cycle design, which used to drive boiler feed water pump and feed regenerative heaters. This design prevailed in US in 1960s and gradually was replaced by condensing turbine due to less efficiency benefits at subcritical steam condition. Reinvention of BEST design in current double reheat cycle is an evitable choice, because the efficiency advantage is improved at USC steam condition. BEST configuration incorporated into current double reheat cycle and advanced cycle is developed to compare with other two conventional systems in this study. Thermodynamic simulation at design and off-design condition shows that BEST configuration has an obvious efficiency advantage at design load, but the advantage decreases at partial load. BEST expansion line and reheat pressure is integrated in cycle heat rate optimization. Genetic algorithm is chosen to implement the optimization and exergy analysis method is utilized to evaluate BEST expansion line optimization results.

Non-opening due to mechanical interlocking or bridging may occur by forming material transfer pips and craters. Investigations revealed (1) the shape of pip and crater and (2) the relative motion between contact pieces as major influencing parameters on the opening process of switchgears when material transfer took place. Changing contact spots, varying force distribution and the accuracy of fit between the corresponding material transfer shapes may cause impeding opening or even interlocking. A novel method allows examining the shapes and relative positions of the material transfer pip and crater. As a result, the spatially resolved gap between the corresponding material transfer shapes on cathode and anode is obtained. The tendency towards interlocking can be expressed by combining the spatial assembly in the contact area and the relative movement of the contact pieces. Analyses demonstrated that AgNi 0.15 experiments were less vulnerable with regard to interlocking than the experiments with Ag/SnO2-88/12. Finally it could be shown that the shape of the transferred material and the prevailing opening trajectory of the contact system relevantly co-determine the opening capability and reliability of switchgears when material transfer takes place. © VDE Verlag Gmbh Berlin Offenbach."
341,Schroeder R.; Zitkus M.; Czyszczewski M.; Rovagnati B.,Simulating pressure transient events in the fuel gas supply to a multi-block combined cycle plant,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","As power plant combustion turbines (CTs) are pushed towards higher thermal efficiencies, increased attention is being given to operating requirements for their fuel gas supply such as the maximum allowable rate-of-change in pressure. It is important to perform detailed analyses for multi-unit plants to ascertain whether pressure transient events, such as those caused by initial trip of one or two combustion turbines, will cause additional combustion turbines to trip off. In this paper, single and dual CT trips were postulated in a near-realistic combined cycle power plant. Predictions of the gas flow behavior, along with propagation and superposition of pressure waves, was carried out using the method of characteristics (MOC) for compressible flows. Specifically, the rate of change in fuel gas supply pressure to each CT was monitored and compared against a typical manufacturer limit of 0.8 bar/s. Instances where simulations showed this threshold exceeded were noted, since such events correspond to automatic valve closure that would shut down one more CT and thereby further reduce plant electrical output. The overall goal of fuel gas transient analyses is to improve pipeline designs, iteratively when necessary, such that those additional trips are avoided. To that end, this paper presents several simulation cases to illustrate pressure transient phenomena and to show the impact of various pipeline design alterations, some of which caused 40% reductions in the worst pressure rate-of-change during simulations.

Particle packing fractions of ∼60% were the prime focus in the current study as the targeted application is the use of dense particulate media as heat transfer fluids (HTF). Experimental and computational studies were previously conducted to understand the influence of different geometrical parameters on the flow physics [1], [2]. Flowrate, particulate velocity, and packing fraction profiles were studied for different inertial numbers and preliminary observations were made about the corresponding regimes. However, flow characteristics that could have a direct implication on the heat transfer behavior remained unexplored. Hence, the current effort serves as an extension of our previous studies. The threedimensional computer simulations were conducted by implementing the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the Lagrangian modelling of particles. Hertz-Mindilin models were used for the soft-particle formulations of inter-particulate contacts. Since the particle contact behavior plays an important role in the conduction heat transfer of these regimes [3], the particle-wall residence times and near-wall packing fractions are studied in the current work. Particle fluctuations, which lead to flow agitation that effect heat transfer [4] are also studied. It was observed that the intermittent nature of the flow resulted in the propagation of wave-like structures in the upstream direction. The characteristics of this phenomenon and its possible influence on the heat transfer physics is also discussed. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The analysis of the concept carried out in this paper has strengthened the idea of the necessity to face the modular design approach in the early stages of the design. This is particularly important in the accommodation and common spaces, where the benefit of the increase of the use of the modular solutions is even higher than in other parts of the warship. In this respect the elements associated to the detail 3D model of the standard modules may be used in all kinds of 2D and 3D drawings as well as in reports for further use in production. All the attributes and technological information given to the elements would also be available to be shared with other applications handling other parts of the project: planning, material management and others. The standard module, once designed and saved could be used, instanced, in the 3D model of the warship as many times as required. Modern warships comprise large extends of equipment for propulsion and ship operation which consists of mechanical parts, electronics, tubes, cables, switchboards etc. Machinery equipment contributes significantly to the performance of the warship as well as to material and personnel cost. Modularization can help to reduce the risk of failure by using pretested equipment, to reduce purchasing cost as well as to pre-manufacture machinery units in the workshop. The aim of this paper is to develop concepts and design solutions for modular machinery space, on-board automation and warship equipment. In addition methods for modular design are developed and finally the solutions are demonstrated by practical solutions.

At the end of the current 12th plan, the capacity of AC substations is projected to be 6,69,801 MVA with another 22,500 MVA coming from HVDC Bi-pole stations .In terms of CAGR this translates into a growth of 8.56% till the end of the 12th plan. With a massive plan of integrating and evacuating renewable energies, this growth in capacity is set to rise during the 13th plan ending in 2022.The demands and expectations of a substation's operation is continually evolving with the complex flows and the security needs that have come to characterise the modern grid. The evolution of standards have helped to ease many issues relating to engineering, safety, security, self-healing based availability, refurbishments and life-cycle costs. In adopting these standards, the future full digital substation should ideally adapt legacy multi-generational devices. It should be able to build on them to provide new generation technologies required to optimally manage the substation assets as well as play a focal part in supervision and control of the complex grid flows. This paper looks at the choices available to the utilities to migrate from conventional technologies and harness the full power of the digital substation, the business case for doing so, and ending with a few case histories. This paper consists on the following three main activities. Firstly, evaluate emerging technologies and future trends for the Automation of Substations and the Protection, Monitoring and Control of full digital substation. Secondly, analyse the impact of the IEC 61850 communications standard and the process bus implementation on the Digital Instrumentation and Control of full digital substation. Finally, review novel Assets Condition Monitoring solutions and Predictive Maintenance methodologies for the Protection and Diagnosis of substation switchgears. This paper also consist case studies of various installation of digital substation by Alstom with key befits e.g. time and costs reduction in the substation design, construction, commissioning and maintenance; along with increased quality of service and reduced number of outages; and also guarantied safety, efficiency and increased reliability on the operation of the electric power system. Further describe in this paper different type of model can be adopted by customer for full digital substation and options of refurbishment of existing substation to full digital substation. The basic tenets of a full digital substation architecture comprising of station bus, process bus, digital instrument transformers and communication redundancy based on zero reconfiguration time are now well proven. Test cases on measurement and protection using these new technologies have been found to be as good operationally, if not better than the conventional methods. The architecture throws open standards driven interfacing flexibility in switchgear electronics design, integration of new generation as well as legacy instrument transformers, intra substation & inter substation distributed automation coordination and last but not the least using wide area monitoring for improving situational awareness of grid dynamics.

347,Aziz I.; Hussain S.; Tarar W.; Akhtar I.,Experimental and numerical investigation of vibration damping using a thin layer coating,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","High cycle fatigue (HCF) is the main cause of failure in rotating machinery especially in aircraft engines which results in the loss of human life as well as billions of dollars. More than 60 percent of aircraft accidents are related to High cycle fatigue. Major reason for HCF is vibratory stresses induced in the blades at resonance. Damping is needed to avoid vibratory stresses to reach the failure level. High speed rotating machinery has to pass through the resonance in order to reach the operational speed and chances of failure are high at resonance level. It is therefore required to suppress the vibrations at resonance level to avoid any damage to the structure. Application of coating to suppress vibrations is a current area of research. Various types of coatings have been studied recently. This includes plasma graded coatings, viscoelastic dampers, piezoelectric material damping, and magnetomechanical damping. In this research, the phenomenon of damping using a coating of nickel alloy on a steel beam is studied experimentally and numerically to reduce vibratory stresses by enhancing damping characteristics to avoid aircraft engine and rotating machinery failure. For this purpose, uncoated and nickel alloy coated steel beams are fabricated. The coating procedure was performed using plasma arc method. The beams were then mounted in a cantilevered position and bump and vibration shaker tests were conducted to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes. One of the most important parameter to measure the damping of a system is the damping ratio. In order to determine the damping ratio, vibration analyzer mode was adjusted in time domain and beam was excited by using a hammer. The vibration analyzer showed the vibration decay as a function of time. Using that decay, damping ratio was calculated by using logarithmic decrement method. In order to investigate and compare the damping characteristics of un-coated and coated beams, forced response method was employed. In this method, beams were excited at 1st and 2nd bending mode natural frequencies using vibration shaker. Results were very encouraging and showed a significant improvement in damping characteristics. The experimental results were then endorsed by numerical results which were achieved by performing modal and forced response analysis using finite element analysis techniques. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The growth of internet increases the range of future services that demand more network capacity and higher data rates. Network and system concepts are evolving accordingly using fiber-optic networks with transmission speeds more than 40 Gb/s as the base environment. Therefore, the creation of completely optical networks corresponding equipment is required. One of the basic elements of such network is a switchboard. We propose and analyze layered switch architectures that possess high design flexibility, greatly reduced switch size, and high expandability. The paper proposes a new approach to the construction of switchboards, where the problem of servicing the competitive calls is solved. The basic principle of proposed switchboard construction is the application of multilayered matrix. This architecture is scalable, high-speed, simple, practical, and low-cost, exploiting the workhorses of today’s optical communications systems: arrayed waveguide gratings, distributed feedback lasers, LiNbO3 switches, and low-speed photodiodes. We performed extensive experiments and found that the optimal number of layers which is required to achieve good results is six layers.

A computer modeling approach was used to obtain more detail information during the process of methane hydrate decomposition. A comprehensive Users' Defined Subroutine (UDS) was used in the FLUENT code to model the methane hydrate dissociation by depressurization. The kinetic model and equilibrium condition were contained in the UDS. The new UDS can model the heat and mass transfer during the decomposition process of methane hydrate. The behavior of the methane hydrate decomposition process in both laboratoryscale simulation and micro channels simulation was investigated in this paper. The laboratory-scale simulation results were compared with ones of the laboratory-scale system studied by Masuda et al. to verify the UDS. Evolutions of methane gas, water and hydrate in the cross micro channels were obtained. The phenomenon of water freezing was predicted by comparing the water temperature and freezing temperature. The results also showed that the dissociation process of gas hydrates as well as the water freezing phenomenon occur not only in the interface between hydrate layer and production zone, but also deep in the hydrate zone.

This equipment was installed atop the concrete mezzanine floor deck without provisions for isolating vibration. As a result, structure-borne noise from that equipment travels through the floor, radiates from the underside of the floor deck, and intrudes into the Quiet Room below. This causes the background noise level within the Quiet Room to be too high for conducting low sound level measurements and studies on vehicles brought into the Quiet Room. Conclusions of the study are that provisions originally intended to isolate the Quiet Room from the mezzanine floor deck were both insufficient and poorly installed, resulting in excessive noise transmitted into the Quiet Room. Recommended corrective measures include enhancement of the Quiet Room ceiling to improve the sound transmission loss performance of that assembly, and changes made to the mezzanine floor deck to isolate structure-borne noise. This work is being installed in phases and completion of the initial phase has shown very promising results. Copyright © 2015 SAE International."

The proposed solar collector utilizes a phase change material namely Octadecane paraffin, with melting tem- peratures of 28° C which is categorized as non-toxic with long- term chemical stability PCM. As PCMs particularly in powder form may not be effective by itself due to the poor heat transfer rate, low thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity, by com- bining CNT layers with the high thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity compare to phase change materials, we are able to overcome the shortcomings of PCMs and design an innovative and efficient solar water heater.

The overall goal of this work was to obtain experimental data for validating costeffective approximate mathematical models, used in investigations aimed at the development of numerical methods for assessing the operating limits of current transformers and optimizing the designs of next-generation transformers. The laboratory model used in this work was a vertical, single-phase, closed-loop thermosyphon operating with water as the working fluid. The steady and unsteady behaviors of this closed-loop thermosyphon were established and investigated using the following series of power inputs: 50 W, 125 W, 200 W, 125 W, and 50 W. Each of these levels of power input was maintained until steady-state conditions were achieved; and then the excursion to the adjacent power level (up or down, depending on the position in the aforementioned series) was effected. The corresponding experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper. The steady-state experiments with water as the working fluid are used to obtain valuable benchmarking results and also reliable initial conditions for the unsteady experiments. The experiments with excursions from one power level to an adjacent one provide novel results pertaining to unsteady operation of closed-loop thermosyphons.

Real test has been carried out to demonstrate the TOC concentration in feedwater has been increased as the external heating increases. The presence of organic acid would significantly reduce the pH of the condensate and result in general corrosion, pitting and environment assisted cracking. For the cogeneration thermal power stations in which make-up water were produced with traditional ion exchange system and Integrated Membrane Technology separately, the main factors affecting cation conductivity of steam are residues of the organics in raw water and dynamic variation about bacterial reproduction in reducing environment, respectively. If gel type anion resin had been replaced with macroporous strong base anion resin, the remaining TOC in traditional ion exchange system could be significantly reduced. And if nonoxidative bactericide had been dosed before or after Ultrahigh Purity Filter, bacteria could be effectively killed. For heat-supply units, the actual rates of makeup water, denote with ""N%"", are always more than the design value. So it is very important in this scenario to revise the ceiling values of TOC for makeup water, which should be divided by N, to allow that ceiling value to match the actual rate of makeup water. For drum boilers and once-through boilers which superheated steam pressure are greater than 18.3 MPa, in order to guarantee the cation conductivity (25°C) values of feed water less than the standard of 0.10 μ S/cm, TOC values in feed water should be under 50μ g/L.

Therefore we measured the actual loading data by facilities considering the operating conditions of the plate mill plant in K-Steelworks, after that analyzed these data.

Consequently, the optimization method of capacity for the facilities shall have effectiveness in building new plate mill plant to further reduce costs at future."

We are still considering the constructions of medium voltage switch gears (MVSWGR's) in the conventional way although the vacuum theory has proved. Digital relays with their automation are offering good facilities for sending on the power of medium voltage distribution systems. But, it is still needed for these innovations to be more qualified. This research paper deals with the involvement of a binary function for receiving 11KV either from the extra high voltage National Grid distribution network of 220 kV which is called the modified IEEE 21 bus-Test-case or sending the floating power generation from the refinery to the grid which is called the modified IEEE 23 bus-Test-case and is based on the MATLAB/MATPOWER testing system [2], [3].

Both building costs as well as the level of the transmitted and distributed electrical power have increased rapidly over the recent years and are expected to continue to rise. This means that switchgear manufacturersmust bring more and more compact and powerful systems on the market, while being simultaneously as cost effective as possible. However, because of the strong competition, the development time and costs available for designers are being reduced from year to year. This makes the task extremely difficult forcing the developer to pursue new directions in product development. This paper describes a new development path, so-called ""internal arc based"" as well as the successful qualification of the switchgear ""GMA Efficient"" (gas insulated switchgear) in accordance with the applicable IEC standard and in compliance with the above mentioned requirements. It also describes a fewimportant design rules and innovations, which were necessary to achieve this result. Furthermore it demonstrates how expertise and numerical analysis throughout the development phase are critical to the success of a cost, size and performance optimized switchgear design."

The forces acting on the disc and the shaft are complex in operation. A composite rotor has various dynamic characters for a large capacity nuclear power Turbine-generator comparing with general rotor for its different structure. Numerical simulation was carried out to a composite rotor for a large capacity nuclear power T-G set, so as to analyze the influence of different length to diameter ratio on the vibration characteristics of the low pressure rotor and to study the effect of Interference Amount Between disc and shaft by using the three-dimensional finite element analysis in order to meet the requirements of the good vibration characteristics of the rotor. Firstly, the geometric model of the rotor is set up, and then the element model of the shafting is built, finally natural frequency of the rotor is calculated by using the mechanical module. Vibration characters such as the natural frequency and corresponding mode were obtained by analysis of vibration for the disc and shaft. The effect of the interference fit on critical speeds of the rotors are analyzed preliminarily. The results show that critical speeds of T-G rotor vary sensitively with magnitude of interference.

The metal enclosed switchgear upgrading is based on the patent proposal no. A/00230/14.03.2013 for this purpose and aims at increasing the reliability in the supply of electricity. The modernization consists in eliminating the existing deficiencies of secondary distribution metal enclosed switchgear by replacing the air or SF6 switching devices with vacuum switching devices, by merging the separation and interruption functions (of nominal currents, excess currents or fault currents) in the same multipurpose vacuum switching device, supplemented by the use of another vacuum switching device, for the earthing function. In this way it will be possible for the remote controls to be assigned to all the functions of the metal enclosed switchgear [separationinterruption (simultaneously) or earthing] with vacuum switching devices, thus providing a mechanical endurance with at least a size grade greater than the existing ones. Due to the possibility for remote control of all the functions of the metal enclosed switchgear, the maintenance costs for the entire lifespan will be lower, and the duration of network reconfiguration will be significantly reduced as opposed to current duration, ensuring a higher performance of the supply of electricity to the customers. By using silicone and composite insulation for the general bars of the metal enclosed switchgear and the vacuum switching devices of its equipment, with a leakage path to the mass higher than the existing ones, it will be possible for the metal enclosed switchgears, which have their cable outgoing insulated with sealed potheads to operate in severe environmental conditions, and to be tested and certified according to CEI/ST62271-304/2008. © 2014 IEEE."

These greater capabilities have supported a proliferation of computer controlled boiler functions and, in many cases, replaced human operator functions with automated functions. Nevertheless, the human operator remains a central piece in many modern boiler control systems. One reason the operator is still present in the control room is that computer controls and human operators each have distinct advantages. Consequently, a boiler control system design should balance the best integration of automatic and operator control functions while balancing various requirements and design goals. The following question should then be answered: what roles or functions should be given to the operator vs. to the computer controls? We will address this question by considering the guidance of relevant codes and standards, which have historically influenced control system design for large boilers in power generating applications. An analysis is performed on current and historically relevant standards and codes, including NFPA 85 and its predecessors, to consider how the guidance has changed along with control system technology. The analysis examines provisions directed toward manual and automatic controls to better understand the types of operations that are best-suited for manual functions versus automatic functions. Over time, NFPA 85 and its predecessors responded to the growing automation capabilities by requiring more automatic controls. While the emphasis placed on automatic controls for safety functions has grown, these standards suggest a balance or combination of automatic and manual controls for safety functions. These concepts are considered relative to those of Inherently Safe Design commonly applied in the chemical process industry. Copyright © 2017 ASME."
365,Anantavanich K.; Pietsch G.J.,Calculation of Pressure Rise in Electrical Installations Due to Internal Arcing Taking into Account Arc Energy Absorbers,2016,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"A means to reduce thermal and pressure stress of electrical installations due to internal arcing is the application of arc energy absorbers. Most of them consist of layers of expanded metal with a complex fine structure. The direct consideration of such devices in advanced pressure calculation methods is hardly feasible due to the huge amount of necessary computing capacity. That is why it is reasonable to replace a direct consideration of such absorbers in the calculations by models, which describe in a simplified way the effects of absorbers. The main effects influencing pressure rise are heat absorption and flow resistance. In this contribution, several models describing these effects are presented and implemented in a pressure calculation method, which utilizes a computational fluid dynamics solver to obtain 3-D resolved pressure results. This new approach is applied to some applications and validated by comparing measurements with calculation results. © 2015 IEEE."
366,Kobayashi D.; Takeuchi T.; Nakabeppu K.,Creep damage assessment of notched material made of a solidification control NI-base superalloy using the EBSD method,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","Changes in misorientation with deformation were measured by various misorientation analysis methods using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) method, and quantitative assessments were attempted to estimate the amount of strain or damage. Misorientations were correlated with macroscopic plastic or creep strains for comparative well-strained materials such as austenitic stainless steels. Ni-base superalloys used for components requiring high temperature strength such as gas turbine blades, have low ductility with precipitation of the γ' phase in grains, therefore the change of crystal orientation was considered to be extremely suppressed in comparison with austenitic stainless steels. In addition, it was anticipated that the extremely large grains of Ni-base superalloys made it difficult to properly assess the damage as misorientation. However, with the current advances in the EBSD acquisition systems in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy, it has become possible to make unprecedented resolved measurements of the local crystal structure distribution at a millimeter scale. In particular, in order to assess the damage of gas turbine blades, the complex blade inner cooling system complicates the distribution of temperatures and stresses in the blades, which implies that it is required to assess the influence of geometry at stress concentrated regions in addition to the condition of temperatures, stresses and creep fatigue wave forms. To date, in the case of the conventional casting material or the same geometry notched specimen of the directionally solidified (DS) superalloy, the average misorientation which means the grain reference orientation deviation (GROD) within grains in a certain predetermined evaluation area including the notch increases linearly up to the initiation of creep cracks regardless of the testing temperatures, strain rates and the effect of fatigue under the creep dominant condition. However, the different notch geometry of the DS superalloy shows the different characteristics of the misorientation development. This paper focuses on a misorientation parameter which can assess the creep crack initiation life independent of the geometry at stress concentrated regions. In order to assess the creep crack initiation life at various stress concentrated areas of the DS superalloy, the development of a unified life assessment method independent of the individual notch geometries was discussed. As a result of this study, a parameter dividing the GROD by the initial notch opening value, f0, was proposed and it was confirmed that the proposed parameter, GROD/f0 shows similar characteristics with the relative notch opening displacement (RNOD) curves which correspond to the local strain energy and the initiation of creep crack at the notch tip independent of the geometry at a stress concentrated region.

367,Reid M.; File T.,"Enhancement of an equipment reliability program with smart, connected power plant assets",2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","The U.S. electric utility industry continues to undergo dramatic and accelerating transformation. Reliability and resiliency are a key focus. A number of important issues including cyber and physical security challenges, aging infrastructure, and low natural gas prices continue to be of concern. Significant advances in technology, and prolonged regulatory uncertainty are also contributing factors. Electric utilities are now making substantial investment in renewable resources and other technologies needed for renewables integration. This means a reduction in investment in generation assets and an increase in the transmission and distribution grids. There is also increased investment in providing customers with solutions to lower their costs, reduce their carbon footprint and provide control over their energy management. The transformation ultimately demands significant increases in power plant generation operating capabilities and higher levels of equipment reliability while reducing O&M and capital budgets. Achieving higher levels of equipment reliability, with such tightening budget and resource constraints, requires a very disciplined approach to maintenance and an optimized mix of the following maintenance practices: • Preventative (time-based) • Predictive (condition-based) • Reactive (run-to-failure) • Proactive (combination of 1, 2 and 3 + root cause failure analysis) Preventive maintenance (PM) is planned maintenance actions taken to ensure equipment is capable of performing its required functions. PM tasks are generally time-based, depending on the availability of condition monitoring data through a predictive maintenance (PdM) program. Traditionally, PdM is largely performed by maintenance technicians in the field with handheld devices. Resource constraints usually mean that often weeks or even months elapsed between readings on the same piece of equipment. This approach has limitations with data volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Significant recent advances in sensor and technology associated with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have enabled the transformation of critical power plant assets such as steam turbines, combustion turbines, generators, and large balance-of-plant equipment into smart, connected power plant assets. These enhanced assets, in conjunction with analysis and visualization software, provide a comprehensive on-line conditioning monitoring solution that enables both a reduction in time-based PM tasks and also automation of PdM tasks. This paper describes an approach by Duke Energy to apply smart, connected power plant assets to greatly enhance its fossil generation equipment reliability program and processes. It will outline the value that is currently being realized and will also examine additional opportunities. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The effects of flow rates, viscosities and the surface tensions of the three phases which are called the outer fluid, middle fluid and inner fluid on the size and morphology of the droplets were investigated. The results reveal that if the velocity and viscosity of the outer fluid are increased, the sizes of outer and inner droplets become smaller. By increasing the velocity of the middle fluid, the outer droplets become bigger, while the inner droplet size decreases. As the velocity of inner fluid increases, more inner fluid is injected, which leads to an increment with both outer and inner droplet size. Both of the outer and inner droplet sizes become bigger as the outer surface tension coefficients increase, and for the same reason, the increment with the outer surface tension result in an increase with the outer droplet size, but has no effect on the inner droplet size. Similarly, the droplets morphology almost does not vary with the viscosity of both middle and inner fluid. In fact, the principles revealed above are related with the interaction between the viscosity shear stress and the surface tension. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The Bonga Main Field is situated approximately 120 km offshore Nigeria, in the Gulf of Guinea. The license is operated under a production sharing agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) in partnership with Esso E&P Nigeria Ltd, Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC) and Total E&P Nigeria. The National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), a wholly owned subsidiary of the NNPC, has been delegated full authority to act on behalf of NNPC in all matters pertaining to the PSC. The BNW field is located approximately 10 km north west of the Bonga Main field. Several development concepts were considered for BNW, but due to its proximity to Bonga Main and the ullage that was expected in the Bonga Main facilities from 2014 (mid case), the field could best be developed as a brownfield subsea extension to the Bonga Main hub. This was considered to be the most technically feasible and economically attractive concept that also provided considerable flexibility to manage the impact of remaining uncertainties. The selected development concept which was in two phases comprised a subsea system for up to 9 conventional wells (6 producers and 3 water injectors), with initially, 6 firm wells (4 deviated producers and 2 deviated/horizontal water injectors) targeting the central and southern fault blocks in the BNW 690 and 702 reservoirs. The initial 6 Phase-1 wells develop 129 MMstb from the 690 and 702 reservoirs. The concept required the installation of two 4-slot production manifolds which tied back to the existing PM-1 production manifold via a Cross Over Module (COM), and an extension of the Bonga western injection line with two injection T-junctions (4 slots total). Subsea facilities installed include 13 km of 10-inch X 12-inch pipe-in-pipe quad joints oil flowlines; 4 km of 12-inch diameter water injection flowlines; 15 km of electro/hydraulic umbilicals. Additional installed facilities on the Bonga Main FPSO facility were upgrades including existing Distribution Control System (DCS) to accommodate BNW; four methanol injection pumps and four corrosion inhibition pumps skids, and a new Subsea Controls and Switchgear Building. This paper provides an overview of the development and execution of the project. Focus is given on several strategies applied by the Project Team to successfully manage Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE), quality, the execution contracts, diverse stakeholders, costs, challenges, opportunities, risks and uncertainties, team integration, operational readiness and assurance, to achieve top project delivery performance in a very challenging environment.

The partspan damping snubber and tip damping shroud of the rotor blade and aerodynamic pressure on rotor blade mechanical performance was considered in the one-way model. The twoway fluid-structure interaction model coupled with the mesh deformation technology was conducted to analyze the aerodynamic and mechanical performance of the last stage rotor blade. One-way fluid-structure interaction model numerical results show that the location of nodal maximum displacement moves from leading edge of 85% blade span to the trailing edge of 85% blade span. The position of nodal maximum Von Mises stress is still located at the first tooth upper surface near the leading edge at the blade root of pressure side.

In this method, heat pipe is immersed inside the phase change material, where heat is effectively accumulated and stored for an extended period of time due to thermal insula- tion of evacuated tubes. The proposed solar collector utilizes two distinct phase change materials (dual-PCM), namely Tritri- acontane paraffin and Erythritol, with melting temperature 72°C and 118°C respectively. The integration of Silicone oil for uni- form melting of the PCMs, utilizes the convective heat transfer inside the evacuated tubes, as this liquid polymerized material is well known for its temperature-stability and an excellent heat transfer medium. The operation of solar water heater with the proposed solar collector is investigated during both normal and stagnation (on-demand) operation. The feasibility of this tech- nology is tested via small scale and large scale commercial solar water heaters. Beyond the improved functionality for solar water heater systems, the results from this study show show efficiency improvement of 26% for the normal operation and 66% for the stagnation mode compared with standard solar water heaters that lack phase change materials and silicone oil. The benefit of this method includes improved functionality by delayed release of heat, thus providing hot water during the hours of high de- mand or when solar intensity is insufficient such in a cloudy day and during night time.

However, the accuracy and reliability of any AI-based machinery fault diagnosis is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data fed to the AI model. The hypothesis of this paper is that AIbased fault diagnosis can be further improved by taking into account all the available sensor inputs of the machine. In short, the more sensor inputs fed into the AI model, the more accurate and reliable the outcome of the fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an application of Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory for sensor fusion to improve the accuracy of decisionmaking in machinery fault diagnosis, by fusing all the available vibration signals measured on different axes and locations of the test machine. Vibration signals from different axes and locations of a machinery faults simulator were collected by multiple accelerometers simulating various machinery health conditions, namely healthy, unbalance, misalignment and foundation looseness. The accuracy of fault diagnosis using a different number of sensor inputs was then investigated. Analysis results showed that by combining more sensor inputs using a DS-based algorithm can improve fault detection accuracy from an average of 63% to 83%. In conclusion, the multi-sensor fusion algorithm can be applied to increase the accuracy and reliability of AI-based fault diagnosis. Copyright © 2017 ASME."
374,Huebel M.; Gierow C.; Prause J.H.; Meinke S.; Hassel E.,Simulation of ancillary services in thermal power plants in energy systems with high impact of renewable energy,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","In many parts of the world, the impact of renewable energy, especially from intermittent sources as wind and solar is continuously increasing. In Germany, the share of renewable energy in electricity production is believed to increase from 32.5% in 2015 to 50% in 2030. In order to operate an electrical system and control the mains frequency, the power supply must match the consumption at any time. Ancillary services like primary and secondary control are used to balance the system on a time-scale of several seconds up to 15 minutes. Those control reserves are usually provided by thermal power plants. Particularly in times of high shares of fluctuating renewable feed-in, thermal power plants are turned off or operated at minimum load to avoid electricity production at low electricity prices. However, an amount of about 3000 MW of fast responding primary control need to be provided in the European network of transmission system operators for electricity grid to maintain stable operation even in case of two simultaneous large unit outages. This requirement leads to situations, where thermal power plants are operated in minimum load below their marginal cost to provide control reserves even if there is a surplus of energy in the grid. Operation in low load while at the same time providing control reserves leads to new challenges. As the relation between energy production and the thermal storage capacities provided by the metal and fluid mass in the boiler is decreasing with the load, the ability of responding to control demands is naturally slowed down. Dynamic simulation of the thermodynamic power plant process turned out to be an efficient method to investigate such operational modes. Using comprehensive process models coupled with a control system model, equipment adaptions or control system updates can be evaluated in order to provide faster responses. By increasing the specific amount of ancillary services per unit, the number of units necessary to provide the total amount of primary and secondary control could be reduced in situations with energy surplus.

With tabulation, detailed sodium chemistry can be incorporated in large-eddy simulation (LES), but the expenses of solving stiff Arrhenius equations can be avoided. The sodium release rate from a pulverized-coal particle is assumed to be proportional to the pyrolysis rate, as a simplification. The chemical forms of released sodium is assumed to be atomic sodium Na, because atomic sodium is predicted to be the favoured species in a flame environment. A detailed sodium chemistry mechanism including 5 sodium species, i.e., Na, NaO, NaO2, NaOH and Na2O2H2, and 24 elementary reactions is tabulated. The sodium chemistry table contains four coordinates, i.e., the equivalence ratio, the mass fraction of the sodium element, the gas-phase temperature, and the progress variable. Apart from the reactions of sodium species, hydrocarbon volatile combustion has been modeled by a partially stirred reactor concept. Since the magnitude of sodium species is very small, i.e., at the ppm level, and the reactions of sodium species are slower than volatile combustion, one-way coupling is used for the interaction between the sodium reactions and volatile combustion, i.e., the former having no influence on the latter. A verification study has been performed to compare the predictions on sodium species evolutions in zero-dimensional simulations using the chemistry table against directly using the detailed sodium mechanism under various initial conditions, and their agreement is always good. The PCC-LES solver used in the present study is validated on a pulverized-coal jet flame ignited by a preheated gas flow. Good agreements between the experimental measurements and the LES results have been achieved on gas temperature, coal burnout and lift-off height. Finally, the sodium chemistry table is incorporated into the LES solver to model sodium reacting dynamics in turbulent pulverized-coal combustion. Properties of Loy Yang brown coal, for which sodium data are available, are used. Characteristics of the reacting dynamics of the 5 sodium species in a pulverized-coal jet flame are then obtained. The results show that Na and NaOH are the two major sodium species in the pulverized-coal jet flame. Na, the atomic sodium, has a high concentration in fuelrich regions; while the highest NaOH concentration is found in regions close to the stoichiometric condition. It should be pointed out that the proposed chemistry tabulation approach can be extended to modeling potassium reacting dynamics in turbulent multiphase biomass combustion.

In the program, the integrated effect of three types of heat transfer, i.e. heat conduction, convection and radiation, in the process of heat transfer of receivers has been considered. With integrating the characteristics and the working conditions of receivers of both steam and molten salt, the developed program can be used to perform the thermal performance calculations for the receivers of both working fluids. The proposed program was validated through Solar Two project and the satisfactory results achieve. A steam receiver in a tower-type solar power plant with double superheats is selected as an example for thermal performance calculation. In view of the receiver operating in subcritical status, the thermal performance calculation is carried out for two sections, the one for evaporation and that for superheat. In evaporation section, the working fluid is circulated with a circulating pump at a very high circulating ratio. At the outlet of panels, the qualities of working fluid can reach to maximum about 0.35. Besides, the great difference of qualities of working fluid at the outlet of panels is observed. Even for some pipes of some panels, the working fluid at the outlet is in liquid phase. The distribution of metal temperature at fin end of panels in the evaporation region varies dramatically from place to place and reaches to over 520°C. In superheat region, the temperature of the outer front crown of tubes is concerned. The highest front point temperature of pipe, which reaches to maximum over 660°C, is in the middle region of the last parts of the primary superheat pass. The thermal efficiency distribution of the receiver, including the evaporation and the superheat regions, are also performed. The results show that the averaged efficiency is about 86%. Besides, the phenomenon of negative thermal efficiency happens in both two regions. That is because the solar incidence cannot compensate the natural heat loss due to incident radiation reflection, the pipe wall infrared radiation and convective heat loss. Copyright © 2017 ASME."

This was followed a month later by a flood that completely filled the building that houses WCPP Nos. 1&2, submerging six large synchronous motors, pumps, and related electrical distribution equipment. These nearly simultaneous catastrophic events dramatically expanded and redefined the scope of the planned work. An immediate priority was to rebuild the electrical substation within 12 months so that the District could restore power to the undamaged WCPP No. 3 in order to meet anticipated summer pumping demands. A longer-term priority was to completely rebuild the pumps and motors, and replace the station service motor control centers, switchgear lineups, controls, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning system at WCPP Nos. 1&2 within the next 24 months.

383,Liu X.; Lu L.,Flow characteristics in the improved impinging stream reactor by means of particle image velocimetry(PIV),2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","The impinging Stream is a novel technique in enhancing heat and mass transfer. In the conventional impinging stream reactor (ISR) as the particles in that reactor are affected by the fluid resistance, the energy of the particles is rapidly decreased after the infiltration of the reverse flow, which leads to the effective mixing of the particles. In this paper, we design an improved impinging stream reactor (IISR) that has different fluid inlet velocity but same mean fluid inlet velocity in a period, which still belongs to definition of impinging stream. In the present study, the flow characteristics in the IISR are investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and computational fluid dynamics. The effects of the fluid inlet velocity in the axisymmetric opposed jets are discussed for equal mean volumetric flow rates of the two jets. The impingement plane and the flow filed of the IISR are measured from captured images using the PIV technique. The two fluid inlet velocity with different sinusoidal variations are applied in the improved impinging stream. Besides, the experimental results show that the impingement plane is moving instantaneously with the two inlet velocity changing dynamically, which expands efficient active areas compared with the conventional impinging stream. Besides, computational fluid dynamics are used in combination with the discrete phase model (CFD-DPM) to predict the flow characteristics within the improved Impinging Stream. The simulation results show that impinging stream flow field can be divided into the inlet, the impact zone, the exit zone and the vortex area. At the same time, the impact zone and the impingement plane is also found to be moving The CFD-DPM results give predictions that are in better agreement with the flow filed pictured by the PIV technique. Because of the complexity of the liquid immersion impinging stream, it is difficult to study the trajectory of the particles in the flow field, so we use the numerical simulation to study the motion of the particles in the immersion IISR. Analysis shows the effective mixing region of the particles can be greatly increased, particles' motion trajectory can be longer and the heat and mass transfer between the particles and the interphase can be further enhanced. Compared with the conventional ISR, the IISR has obvious advantages. The results point out this improved impinging Stream has a good application prospect in future engineering works.

Using power converters in similar projects such as harnessing tidal energy through bi-directional rotor blades, or by using direct-drive technology for harnessing tidal and ocean wave energy, are rapidly expanding all around the world. However, power converters are known to have the lowest mean-time-to-failure among turbines' components and have significant impact on increasing the cost of energy, especially at larger MHK turbine scales.

386,Helvaci H.U.; Khan Z.A.,A theoretical and experimental study of HFE-7000 in a small scale solar organic rankine cycle as a thermofluid,2017,"American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Power Division (Publication) POWER","Renewable energy technologies and sources have been playing a key role in reducing CO2 emissions and its footprint. Solar energy which is one of the major renewable energy sources can be utilized by means of solar Photovoltaic (PV) or solar collectors. Concentrating solar collectors supply thermal energy from medium to high grade where as non-concentrating collectors (flat plate) delivers low-grade thermal energy. The use of thermofluids with boiling temperatures lower than water, allows the operation of low grade solar thermal systems on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to generate both mechanical and heat energy. At the same time, the selection of an appropriate thermofluid is an important process and has a significant effect both on the system performance and the environment. Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) are non-ozone depleting substances and they have relatively low global warming potential (GWP). In this study, a solar ORC is designed and commissioned to use HFE 7000 as a thermofluid. The proposed system consists of a flat-plate solar collector, a vane expander, a condenser and a pump where the collector and the expander are used as the heat source and prime mover of the cycle respectively. The performance of the system is determined through energy analysis. Then, a mathematical model of the cycle is developed to perform the simulations using HFE-7000 at various expander pressure values. Experimental data indicates that the efficiency and the net mechanical work output of the cycle were found to be 3.81% and 135.96 W respectively. The simulation results show that increasing the pressure ratio of the cycle decreased the amount of the heat that is transferred to HFE 7000 in the collector due to the increased heat loss from the collector to the environment. Furthermore, the net output of the system followed a linear augmentation as the pressure ratio of the system increased. In conclusion, both the experimental and theoretical research indicates that HFE 7000 offers a viable alternative to be used efficiently in small scale solar ORCs to generate mechanical and heat energy.

Based on an experiment on a ORC system using the dry working fluid R600a, the thermodynamic parameters at the inlet and outlet of the scroll expander, and the output power under the experimental conditions were obtained. The performance of the scroll expander under variable operating conditions was studied. The effect of the superheat amount, inlet temperature, and inlet pressure on the performance of the scroll expander was analyzed. The results show that the scroll expander has good performance under variable operating conditions. The inlet pressure has the greatest influence on the performance of the scroll expander, followed by the inlet temperature, while the working fluid superheat has the least effect. A change in inlet pressure of about 50kPa results in about 20W of output power at the same inlet temperature variation range. While a change in inlet temperature of about 20°C can result in about 15W of output power at the same inlet pressure variation range. The results can provide a reference for the design and operation of the scroll expander.(CSPE) Copyright © 2017 ASME."

The simulation and test models with a small size were established, and the internal pressure rise was calculated under different arc sizes and the surface areas of pressure relief opening. The results show that, when using the indirect coupling analysis method, the relative error of average pressure between test and simulation calculation is just about 2%. The size of arc has no effect on the pressure distribution, but large influence on the temperature distribution.

In order to reduce the temperature difference in receiver tube wall and improve the efficiency of CSP system, the ternary eutectic salt LiF-NaF-KF (46.5-11.5-42 wt.%, hereafter FLiNaK), which has a better high thermal stability than that of nitrate salts at operating temperature of 900 °C, is selected as HTF, and heat transfer performance of FLiNaK in a corrugated receive tube with non-uniform heat flux is simulated by CFD software in the present work. The numerical results reveal that the non-uniform heat flux has a great influence on the temperature distributions of the receive tube and FLiNaK salt. Compared with the result of bare tube, the corrugated tube can not only significantly reduce the temperature difference in tube wall and salt by improving the uniformity of temperature distribution but also enhance the heat transfer of the salt, where the heat transfer coefficient increases with the Reynolds number and heat flux. Moreover, the enhanced effect of the corrugated tube depends on both the pitch and the height of ridges.

As a gas medium, SF6 is chemically inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable, which makes possible the construction of compact SF6 switchgear. One major known disadvantage of the gas is that it has a global warming potential which is 23,900 times higher than CO2. This has led to research into alternative gases with a much lower environmental impact, and one of the emerging candidates is CF3I. The high boiling temperature of CF3I means that it has to be used as part of a mixture inside gas-insulated equipment. To carry out the investigation on CF3I, a scaled-down coaxial system that replicates the maximum electric field of a 400 kV GIL system was designed and fabricated.

Current transformer is packaged in the GIS pipe. Bushing current transformer and pot-type circuit breaker are widely used in the building 750kV power transmission and transformation project. In these projects, the ratio of CT reaches 4000A/1A, even 5000A/1A, because of large power exchange. In the ordinary case, the capability of voltage regulator and booster can not meet the requirements of on-site calibration experiment. Through designing a reasonable test circuit and choosing proper reactive compensation, we can greatly reduce the needed capability of power supply and voltage regulator. The principle of reactive power compensation is discussed in this paper. Several different methods of reactive power compensation are analyzed and compared. The discussed testing program has been successfully applied in several substations, such as the 750 kV substation at the east of Lanzhou. The experimental results indicate that the reactive power compensation can be widely used in the on-site calibration experiments in the 750 kV and 1000 kV UHV demonstration project."

The three old gas absorption chiller-heaters were replaced, each with a bank assembly of eight modular electric chillers served from spare existing 800-amp bolted pressure switches in the existing switchgear in the basement. The cooling tower target nozzles were replaced with smaller orifice nozzles to properly help distribute the reduced condenser water flow required by the new chiller banks. For the same amount of cooling produced, the new electric chillers were installed that use and reject one-third less thermal energy compared to the old absorption chillers. All six new modular boilers were automatically controlled for lead-lag operation so as to inject heat into the building heating water supply main as needed to maintain the supply main temperature."

To demonstrate the phenomena in UJT, a circuit design is proposed which is based on basic circuit of relaxation oscillator employing UJT. However an additional resistor is employed at the emitter terminal which shows reflection at the base terminal. The proposed resistance phenomena in UJT is observed through simulation results and verified experimentally on the actual hardware by building the proposed relaxation oscillator design on a bread board. The experimental results verify our proposed phenomenon in UJT. We have performed experiments to check variation with supply voltage and to analyze variation with change in Re and Rb1, which verify our proposed phenomenon that the resistance at emitter gets reflected at base B1. Thus we propose a new design parameter for UJT, resistance transfer parameter (γ) which governs the transfer of emitter resistance to the terminal B1 of the UJT. The proposed phenomena and transfer parameter (γ) of UJT resembles with the behavior of bipolar junction transistor (BJT), which in turn verify our proposed phenomenon. Moreover our modified relaxation oscillator generates wide duration pulses which in turn can be used in various applications like SCRs, gate-turn-off thyristor requiring large duration trigger pulses. © 2012 IEEE."

The fundamental safety-related requirements for the building project were already specified in the planning stage. The planned measures also included a professional lightning protection system. After construction was completed, a new assessment was carried out by a surveyor. In this survey, the originally calculated measures for external lightning protection realized according to standard by the lightning protection specialist with reference to the specified demands were deemed insufficient for achieving the required lightning protection level. Additional measures for obtaining the higher lightning protection level were coordinated between the manufacturing company and the lightning protection specialist and realized promptly. By using the already installed lightning protection system, the higher demands were realized according to the object-specific requirements. The internal lightning protection was implemented following DIN EN 62305 according to the special application requirements. All live parts of the low voltage power system as well as the control and communication technology of the re-cooling system on the roof were included in the equipotential bonding of each lightning protection zone with surge protection devices at the interfaces of the protection zones. The wiring systems leading inside the building were also connected to surge protection devices in the local switchgear and included in the equipotential bonding. This practical example shows that normative specifications as described in the lightning protection standard do not have to remain theoretical, but can be realized consistently by involving lightning protection specialists. This way, the lightning protection system will guarantee the availability, system safety and personnel safety on a continuing basis."

A large number of electrical brands and products together with a lack of power efficiency information provide complications for HVAC engineers and designers in predicting power equipment heat loss. This is very true for LV and MV switchgear. Environmental heat gain information is very important for sizing HVAC equipment. The objectives of this paper are to update information on heat loss by LV and MV switchgear and to show these losses can be predicted. Two spreadsheet models are presented that calculate the power loss for low and medium voltage switchgear and practical examples are shown for each case using realistic information. The spreadsheets provide an approximation of the dissipated power losses if actual current loadings are used. However, if breaker and bus amp ratings (unknown loading case) are used in place of the actual loadings, the dissipated power loss ofthe L V and MV switchgear will be overestimated. This emphasizes the need of using the actual loadings for each bus and circuit breaker to obtain realistic results. ©2009 ASHRAE."

The rate of heat dissipated from a panelboard depends upon the power loss of the breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars. Information collected from measurements and published literature is used to build the power loss models for the panelboard components. Using these component models, the power panelboard loss model is created based on the sum of the component power losses. A portion of this paper is devoted to illustrating panelboard construction details. Finally, the power panelboardloss model is used in a heat gain example, demonstrating the model's use. The information in this paper is based on findings resulting from RP-1395. ©2011 ASHRAE."

This leads to an extreme pressure stress acting on switchgear compartments and switchgear rooms and could cause collapse of buildings. In order to predict the overpressure, pressure calculations become essential. Nowadays, pressure calculations are performed by two methods [1]. The first method is the ""CFD method"" (Computational Fluid Dynamics calculation method), which employs the finite volume method yielding to spatially resolved results. The second one is the ""ISC method"" (Improved Standard Calculation method) providing spatially averaged results. However, the validity range of the ISC method needs to be investigated. The investigation of the validity range of the ISC method is done by varying some parameters like shape and size of the switchgear room, size and position of the pressure relief opening to the environment, etc. Then, the pressure developments from both methods are systematically compared. Based on these comparisons the ISC method tends to yield under estimated results due to the influence of pressure waves in the case of air-insulated switchgear. However, in the case of SF6 insulated switchgear, the ISC method provides over estimated values of the maximum pressure compared to the CFD results. © 2011 IEEE."

In this paper, we are interested in another aspect of queueing theory, the constructions of queues via switched delay lines (SDLs). We consider three types of discrete-time queues: linear compressors, nonovertaking delay lines, and flexible delay lines. These three types of queues correspond to certain conditional nonblocking switches and (in a strict sense) nonblocking switches in switching theory. Analogous to their counterparts in switching theory, there exist multistage constructions for these three types of queues. Specifically, we develop a two-stage construction of a linear compressor. For nonovertaking delay lines and flexible delay lines, however, we develop a three-stage construction. Moreover, a flexible delay line can also be constructed by a layered Cantor network. As applications of these constructions, we show two optical switch architectures that achieve exact emulation of output-buffered switches. © 2009 IEEE."
438,Gu F.-C.; Chang H.-C.; Kuo C.-C.,Gas-insulated switchgear PD signal analysis based on Hilbert-Huang transform with fractal parameters enhancement,2013,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,"This study proposes a novel method of partial discharge (PD) electrical signal analysis based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) with fractal feature enhancement. Firstly, this study establishes four defect types of 15 kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and uses a commercial high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) to measure the electrical signals caused by the PD phenomenon. Second, the authors applied HHT for the PD electrical signal process. The HHT can represent instantaneous frequency components through empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and then transform to a 3D Hilbert energy spectrum. Finally, this study extracts the fractal parameters from the 3D energy spectrum and uses a neural network (NN) for PD recognition. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this study uses 160 sets of fieldtested PD patterns generated by GIS, and then compares the recognition rate of the signal with and without the EMD process. The result shows that the proposed method can easily separate various defect types. The method can also be employed by the construction unit to verify the GIS quality and determine the GIS insulation status. © 2012 IEEE."
439,,GAMBICA concern over new IEC standard for electrical assemblies,2010,Engineer,"GAMBICA'S Controlgear Group Technical committee has welcomed the publication of IEC 61439, the new series of international standards for low-voltage switchgear and control-gear assemblies, which will soon be implemented in the UK as BS EN 61439. It warns, however, that manufacturers working to the new standard still need to exercise a high level of skill and caution in relation to the ratings they adopt for components used in their assemblies. These test conditions are very different from the conditions in which the component will operate when installed in a power switchgear orcontrolgear assembly (PSC). As a result, substantial de-rating may be needed to ensure safe operation and to comply with the temperature rise requirements of IEC 61439. In effect, nominal component ratings should be considered only as a starting point for making sound engineering decisions relating to PSC design and construction."

For most of AVR in the synchronous generator for ships, it uses the way of phase control thyristor. The period of this method, however, is slower than a converter composed of MOSFET or IGBT, thereby having difficulties to implement rapid response control. In addition, regarding to the existing analogue AVR, there is a demerit that it is difficult to monitor the system so it may not provide convenience for the user. Therefore, this paper implemented a PMG type digital AVR using MOSFET on a synchronous generator for ships.

In Section 18, the CEC requires that the Zone method of hazardous area classification be used for all new installations. The Code is not specific about the products used and permits both IEC and Class/Division products. Both the US based National Electrical Code (NEC) and internationally based IEC deal with hazardous locations. These differ to varying extents to the CEC in their acceptable products and installation methods. In Alberta Canada, the authority having jurisdiction, or regulator, has permitted qualified users the flexibility to adapt or combine elements from the CEC, NEC and IEC into a single operating system to take advantage of the best in global technologies. This has resulted in a unique blended system that combines the best of the traditional North American and International approaches and provides cost savings over traditional electrical installations. This ""hybrid system"" not only maintains the benchmarks for reliability and safety, it has improved or enhanced them. In developing this approach, users have seen significant reductions in installation costs. Some examples include modularization using plug-and-play wiring systems for heat tracing, lighting systems, and power distribution, basket tray, hybrid panel boards and modular construction (re-locatable structures/buildings and packaged equipment). While many of these concepts were initiated for material and labour installed cost efficiencies, they have ultimately yielded in significant reliability, maintainability and safety enhancements recognized afterwards.

In this paper, a new method of de-noising, using complex Daubechies wavelet (CDW) transform, has been proposed. It is a relatively recent enhancement to the real-valued wavelet transform because of two important properties, which are nearly shift invariant and availability of phase information. Those properties give CDW transform superiority over other real-valued wavelet transform. On the basis of CDW transform, complex threshold algorithm and combined information are devised. In order to take into account the difference of the real part and imaginary part of complex wavelet coefficients, complex threshold is devised to modify the real part and imaginary part respectively. Because the restored signal by inverse CDW transform is complex one, combined information is devised to combine the real part and imaginary part of complex signal to construct a real one, furthermore making full use of the simple information from complex signal.

For the competition the end-users put more than one brand on the preferred vendors list. The Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor will buy the cheapest brand of the vendors list. This means selection is based on minimizing the Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) rather than minimizing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), being the sum of CAPEX and Operating Expenditures (OPEX). Analyzing the TCO it becomes clear the OPEX can be divided into two segments. The first one is the controlled OPEX which can clearly be calculated. The a second segment of OPEX however is not that clear and is depending on Risk. Risk is defined as the product of a probability a situation during lifetime of the product will take place and the consequences it will have for the process in which the product is fulfilling it's role. Controlling risk means reducing the probability or limiting the consequences. Some tools out of the field of asset management used by utilities are applied for a Low Voltage Motor Control Centre (MCC) to give guidance how decisions can be argued. As will be found limiting the consequences can be translated into mandatory and preferred specifications that can be used in a tender. But what will happen when one of the brands on the preferred vendor list has a product development that will increase the CAPEX and will reduce the TCO, e.g. will reduce the risk. To take specific manufacturer specifications into account, it will demand that the purchase process find a way to take this into account, by having more aspects as CAPEX only to make the decision to which vendor the project will be granted."

Recent work on differential power analysis shows that even mathematically-secure cryptographic protocols may be vulnerable at the physical implementation level. By measuring energy consumed by a working digital circuit, it is possible to gain valuable information about the encryption algorithms used and even the specific encryption keys. Thwarting such attacks requires a new approach to logic and physical designs. This paper presents a systematic approach to fault tolerant cryptographic hardware designs. Firstly, the effectiveness of the Hamming code based error correction schemes as a fault tolerance method in stream ciphers is investigated. Coding is applied to Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) based stream cipher implementations. The method was implemented on industrial standard stream ciphers, e.g. A5/1(GSM), E0 (Bluetooth), RC4 (WEP), and W7. The performance variation of stream cipher algorithms with error detection and correction was studied by synthesising the designs on Field Programmable Logic Arrays (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Further, we analyse hardware building blocks to minimise switching activity of a circuit over all possible inputs and input transitions by adding redundant gates and increasing the overall number of signal transitions. We also discuss the overhead and compositional properties of uniformly-switching circuits. © 2010 IEEE."

The design of electrical and mechanical power systems can apply a ""Darwinian"" approach in sizing the components and in drawing the layout for minimizing the seismic stresses during an earthquake. This kind of evolution has to aim in preventing more than protecting damages to systems operability. All the components should have adequate ratings and be installed in a proper manner to provide a reliable and safe electrical system after or during earthquake. The electrical engineer and mechanical engineer should work closely with the structural engineer. The paper suggests a comparison among different international approaches in simplified evaluation of the seismic forces to assist the design electrical engineers and highlights the need that the constructors of equipment essential to the service continuity, as transformers, switchboards, generator sets, uninterruptible power supplies, motors driving critical loads, have to promote certified tests of their seismic behavior and to make available their basic seismic parameters. © 2011 IEEE."

Nonlinear load is a load that draws none sinusoidal current wave when supplied by a sinusoidal voltage source. Much attention has been focused on large power converters as sources of harmonics due to the high magnitude of the currents evolved. Nevertheless, harmonics generated by low power converters become significant when large numbers of converters are used simultaneously. In this paper the influence of the personal computers in the line current harmonics in some buildings at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) have been investigated. The harmonics were monitored from the main switched boards of each building that has the highest number of PC’s and from the switch boards of each computer labs in these buildings. This investigation may help in pinpointing the harmonic generating sources, effects, and how to mitigate, also to obtain the actual PC operation of the university and its harmonic contribution. Measurements indicate that two buildings of the highest PC's numbers do have harmonics but one building harmonics is higher than that allowed by IEEE-519 standards [1] limits and the other does not influence phase current and it is within allowable limits. © 2012, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

The transmitter initially designed and developed, had the following limitations: 1. The transmitter was operational for only eight hours on continuous run, while the requirement was for 48 hour endurance. Redesign of collector transformer including modification of the core dimensions was carried out by analysing heat dissipation problem. 2. The system was not operating at sub-zero temperatures whereas the system demanded operation right from -20 deg to +55 deg. 3. The transmitter design used an imported spark gap and used liquid dielectric as the medium for insulation and cooling the crow bar hardware requiring too much maintenance efforts and also ceramic (HV) bushings were used for HV connectivity adding to the complexity. 4. The transmitter operation at all spot frequencies required readjustments and fine tuning at pre-regulator stage to deliver the required power output which put a restriction on the automatic frequency change over during frequency agility operation. 5. Better MTI Cancellation required improvement of modulator pulse shape. 6. Introduction of high voltage connectors at module level avoiding the HV exposure to open air thus avoiding corona inception. 7. Also for ease of maintenance and improved reliability of the transmitter, modularization, good mechanical engineering, thermal design and packaging were essential. This case study fully analyses the above drawbacks of the transmitter and provides detailed account of the re-design and improvements carried out on the TWT based transmitter for Phased Array Radar. The HV engineering improvements, crow-bar design and inverter-pre-regulator testing and integration to develop 37KV to operate under sub-zero temperatures; miniaturization and packaging will be presented in this paper. It also enabled the authors to replace the imported spark gap with an indigenous one thereby saving lot of foreign exchange and contributing to the self-reliance. The High Voltage power supplies are critical sub-systems which are designed as a combination of high frequency switching type for cathode (37 KV) and mains frequency step up transformer type for collector (26 KV). The accurate maintenance of cathode voltage was achieved through on-off regulation scheme using A to D converter. The collector supply is unregulated, 6 KW floating at 37 KV. The modulator design is based on two regulated supplies and has a switching circuit with two active switches to generate flat pulse with 100 nano Sec rise and fall time to support 10 micro sec pulse width and staggered PRF around 2 KHz for better MTI improvement of the radar. Partition of LV and HV power supplies, modulator housing based on Faraday cage for better high voltage insulation capability. For good EMI compatibility in the transmitter, separation of high power switching circuits and sensitive feedback and the logic circuits was resorted to. Grounding scheme for LV and HV stages has been appropriately carried out for avoiding mutual interference. This transmitter is produced by production agency (BEL) through technology transfer and is used in two programmes-Weapon Locating Radar for Army and Rajendra Radar for Akash Missile system for IAF. The aim of this paper is to present the modifications in the cathode power supply, modulator, crow-bar redesign, HV engineering and modularization of the transmitter which resulted in considerable improvement in the performance of the transmitter for Weapon Locating Radar, which was subsequently used in Battery Level Radar III for Akash missile system also. © 2011 IEEE."

It became obvious that both, manufacturers and users had to develop environmental awareness and hence started to collaborate on the environmental analysis of the three following technologies for a Swiss 380/220 kV substation, named Rüthi: Air Insulated Substation with Live Tank circuit breakers (AIS Live Tank), Air Insulated Substation with Dead Tank circuit breakers (AIS Dead Tank) and Gas Insulated Switchgear substation (GIS substation). The study evaluates the impacts of the three technologies on 16 environmental issues with EDIP method and shows that none of them is the most environmental-friendly solution regarding all those 16 issues. Consequently results should be weighted according to the relative importance of the environmental issues to determine which solution is globally the best but this step implies subjective choices. The comparison of a complete 380/220 kV substation as AIS Live Tank, AIS Dead Tank and GIS substation presented in this paper is specifically adapted to Rüthi substation and its conclusions could change if in another context. A Compact arrangement, in general small footprint besides the very important fact, of a resulting low busbar resistance, are key environmental advantages of GIS Substation technologies. It has to be mentioned that, in the studied case, the footprint advantage of the GIS substation is, due to the high number of High voltage incoming lines, of no important relevance and hence not considered in the analysis. The source of electricity generation has important impacts on most of EDIP environmental issues. On the contrary, the fact that all live equipment of GIS substation is insulated with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas is a drawback for this solution as regards global warming issue. Finally, the absence of building in Air Insulated Substations avoids impacts due to the production and end-of-life treatment of building materials and is an advantage for AIS Live Tank and AIS Dead Tank solutions. Power transformer is dominant on most of EDIP environmental issues. But this element is common to the three versions of Rüthi substation under study, creating no differentiation between them. A comparison of power transformer technologies could help reducing total environmental impacts of Rüthi substation."

Capital Electric Construction was the contractor that performed $38-million worth of electrical installations. The first step of the project included relocating all the medium-voltage distribution feeders and switchgear feeding the complex to accommodate for the larger stadium footprint. The company spent six months performing preconstruction estimating, design review, value engineering, and constructability reviews. It started shifting all normal and emergency electrical distribution systems with the understanding that power had to be restored by August 2009 for the forthcoming football season."

Traditional current transformers (CTs), which are generally used in GISs for current measurement, consist of magnetic cores. These cores are bulky and increase the minimum space required inside GISs. Moreover, the occurrence of faults causes saturation in traditional CTs; this leads to distortion of detected current waveforms, which in turn triggers false responses in protective systems. The recently proposed power current microsensors based on the Hall effect have many advantages over traditional CTs, including smaller volume, quicker response, and wider measurement range, and they do not face the above-mentioned saturation problem. This study assesses the feasibility of replacing traditional CTs inside GISs with power current microsensors, taking into account certain actual conditions, including: (1) the actual distance between two adjoining cables inside GISs, (2) the worst unbalanced three-phase loads allowed by typical primary distribution substations, and (3) the four most common faults occurring in primary distribution substations. Current simulation and measurement results show that power current microsensors can measure current as accurately as traditional CTs. Moreover, during faults, microsensors do not encounter problems related to saturation, which exist with traditional CTs. © 2012 The Chinese Institute of Engineers."

If the risk of maintaining unsold inventory can be decreased, even small-volume manufacturers may be able to justify holding more significant quantities of versatile inventory. This paper discusses a component commonality effect to breakthrough the trade-off relationship between inventory levels and delivery lead-times for such small-volume production systems. By using the same component in different products, inventory maintenance costs can be dramatically reduced, but component commonality design problems are inherently complex, since excessive module commonality may lead to lower product performances, and there are trade-off relationships between product performance and cost reductions obtained through component commonality. In this paper, such a design problem is formulated as a multiobjective component commonality design optimisation problem considering inventory level, delivery lead-time and product performance, and the optimal solutions are obtained as a Pareto optimal solution set. Detailed procedures concerning the proposed design method, including inventory simulation, are discussed and developed for a switchgear design problem. Finally, an example switchgear design problem is solved to illustrate that optimal use of component commonalities across different modules can significantly reduce inventory costs, while also shortening product delivery lead-times. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

Series compensation, likewise, is an efficient means for minimizing the amount of transmission lines needed for a certain power transmission capability of an inter-connector. With series capacitors, the capability of already existing power lines can be increased considerably, thereby decreasing the need for building new lines in cases where the need for power transmission capability in a system is growing. Installing series compensation is typically also less costly as well as less time consuming than building new lines. The paper presents some basic mechanisms for series compensation in power grids, fixed as well as thyristor-controlled, some salient design features as well as operational experience for improving interregional power transfer in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way."

There is no zero electric field on the particle tip of a particle in the inter-phases region, except S90 particle. There is zero electric field on the particle tip of a particle in the phase-enclosure region every half cycle of applied voltage. The maximum electric field of the particles on the interphases region generally is higher than one of the particles on the phase-enclosure region.

495,Siren K.; Pennanen A.,Electrical systems procurement by means of target costing,2013,"21st Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction 2013, IGLC 2013","Electrical systems are typically procured through detailed drawings and specifications. In the case of an intense project timetable, the procurement process lacks time to commit the potential suppliers to the project and to compile precise and detailed design and bidding documents. This paper introduces methodology for preparing the tendering documents directly from the performance criteria set for electrical systems before the electrical design commences. In Finland, target costing methodology in construction is based on a constructive Building Information Model (BIM) prior design. Component-level target costing uses performance criteria set for the spaces (such as 400 lux lighting) as initial information. The result with a BIM design is a priced bill of quantities that indicates the target cost for the future design process. In this paper, it has been used as a tendering document before the start of design. For the most part, HVACE systems are composed of a producing element, a linking element, and a functional element. For instance, the elements in lighting are the switchboards, cables, and luminaires, and those in cooling are cooling units, pipes, and cooling beams. These elements can be modelled through building-information-modelling-based prior design. In the case studies of this paper, the electrical systems suppliers were selected before the electrical design. The suppliers have given positive feedback because of the ease of tendering, opportunity to participate in the design, and possibility to schedule the work on their sites earlier. Managing the changing quantities in the contracts has been possible because of the unit pricing for costs. The target costing process and design steering during the design have ensured successful cost management."

We have focused our attention to the algorithms for reactive power calculation under periodic and nonharmonic condition. On real instrument we performed series of tests and developed an improvement to an existing algorithm to achieve better precision while using the available processing time. Proposed method is modular, meaning that calculation is performed in several steps, which are continuously improving the precission of result. Due to this behavior it is possible to optimally use the processing time and improve or speed-up calculation of reactive power in steady and periodic state.

Part of the Emergency Storage Project was the construction of the San Vicente Pumping Facilities capable of moving up to 200 million gallons per day from the San Vicente Reservoir to the Water Authority's water delivery system. The San Vicente Pumping Facilities, designed by Black and Veatch and MWH, were completed under two separate contracts: 1) Pre-procurement of major equipment and 2) Construction of the facilities. On March 25, 2006, the San Diego County Water Authority awarded Gierlich -Mitchell, Inc. with the procurement, delivery and commissioning, including but not limited to, three horizontal centrifugal pumps, three 7,000 HP Induction Motors, three pump control panels and programming, and two Medium Voltage Variable Frequency Drives and transformers. Shortly after, on November 30, 2006, the Water Authority awarded Kiewit Pacific Co., with the construction of the facilities, which included the San Vicente Pump Station and San Vicente Surge Control Facility. Construction of the facilities included: the pump station building; hydraulic systems; cooling water systems; primary power service and switchgear systems; excavation and construction of a three million gallon pre-stressed concrete surge tank; over 3,000 feet of large diameter pipe ranging from 84 inch to 102 inch; and installation of all pre-procured major equipment. Early on it was clear to all parties involved that the commissioning of this new facility would be complex and challenging; spanning multiple contracts and specialties, and its successful operation would be completed as a result of identifying potential issues early, communicating with all parties involved and maintaining a common goal. Typical of many new facilities, especially those with pre-purchased equipment, the phases of construction and commissioning became overlapping and blurred. As a result, the Water Authority recognized the need to coordinate startup and commissioning meetings early on in the construction phase to define the roles, responsibilities, and most importantly, to discuss the details of the required deliverables of all parties involved so all programmers, suppliers and contractors had the same understanding of the work which needed to be accomplished. One of the more difficult challenges was the integration of multiple programs, I/O signals, and communication protocols across the Human Machine Interface (HMI), master Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), individual Pump PLCs, and various other signal sources communicating over MODBUS, Foundation Field Bus, Ethernet, Control Net, Analog, etc. As with many projects that span a five year time period from design to completion, the technical assumptions, supporting technologies, and operating conditions can evolve, redefining the acceptance criteria for successful commissioning. As a result it was critical that the commissioning team stay committed to the facilities operational goals while considering multiple technical solutions to issues that would arise during testing. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineering."

MV/LV The approach used for thermal design of prefabricated substations has often been either: --practical, i.e. by iteration: tests, measurements, corrections, by calculations based on analytical formulas used in building design, where many heat transfer coefficients are established arbitrarily and can cause the result to vary significantly. The digital calculation method for thermal performance not only allows all of the thermal phenomena of the prefabricated substation to be considered, but also takes into account its architecture and the fact that several systems, such as the LV switchboard, MV switchboard and the transformer, are installed inside. Thermal modelling of the whole of these systems allows prefabricated substation use to be optimised, and many different configurations to be met by varying the different parameters of the model. The thermal master of MV / LV prefabricated substations allows to model other kiosks included other kinds of components. Numerical modeling allows us to fully know the internal temperature or components incorporated. The end purpose is of course to design an optimised, and even more importantly, safer product for our customers all over the world.

Although the U.S. Navy has used cold ironing for decades at naval facilities around the world, its application in a commercial context is relatively new. This paper describes the process of design development and of securing building permits for a cold ironing system at Pier G Phase 2 Wharf in the Long Beach Harbor Department (LBHD) District, more widely known as the Port of Long Beach (POLB). The first step in designing the shore-to-ship power system at POLB involved developing design standards, since none were available for this type of commercial power supply system. The three main considerations were: establishing a ship voltage and electrical load standard for ships presently in service and those that will be in service 10-15 years from now; developing shore-to-ship electrical connection hardware; and designing system safety requirements. Subsequent design considerations included appropriate wharf structure and transformer/switchgear components. The permitting process was also unusual. The Permits Section of the Long Beach Building Department had never had plans submitted for a cold ironing system. Concerns were shared with the Plan Check Reviewers on the overall system, and operational standards were developed to ensure safe operating conditions for the cold ironing system. These extra steps in the permitting process were necessary to secure the building permits required to construct the project. Copyright ASCE 2007."

A multilayered tree is built first to organize all covariance matrices into a hierarchical structure. Kullback-Leibler divergence is used in the tree-building to measure inter-Gaussian distortion and successive splitting is used to construct the multilayer covariance tree. To cope with the data sparseness problem in estimating a full covariance matrix, we interpolate the diagonal covariance matrix of a leaf-node at the bottom of the tree with the full covariance of its parent and ancestors along the path up to the root node. The interpolation coefficients are estimated in the maximum likelihood sense via the EM algorithm. The interpolation is performed in three different parametric forms: 1) inverse covariance matrix, 2) covariance matrix, and 3) off-diagonal terms of the full covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm is tested in three different databases: 1) the DARPA resource management (RM), 2) the switchboard, and 3) a Chinese dictation. In all three databases, we show that the proposed tree-based full covariance modeling consistently performs better than the baseline diagonal covariance modeling.

Indeed, simplifying assumptions on the sequences of modes are usually adopted, also in order to obtain averaged models and discrete-time maps. In this paper, we show how the complementarity framework can be used to represent complete switched models of a wide class of power converters, with EDs having characteristics represented by piecewise-affine (even complicated) relations. The model equations can be written in an easy and compact way without the enumeration of all converter modes, eventually formalizing the procedure to an algorithm. The complementarity model can be used to perform transient simulations and time-domain analysis. Mathematical tools coming from nonlinear programming allow to simulate numerically the transient behavior of even complex power converters. Also rigorous time-domain analysis is possible without excluding pathological situations like, for instance, inconsistent initial conditions and simultaneous switchings. Basic converter topologies are used as examples to show the construction procedure for the complementarity models and their usefulness for simulating the dynamic evolution also for nontrivial operating conditions. © 2009 IEEE."

In pulsed power systems of the future, the role of trigger systems are even more critical as they trigger more components and produce shaped-pulses by independent timing of individual switches or switch groups. Conventional trigger systems require high voltage trigger cables or line-of-sight optics that complicate design, demand space, and require extensive maintenance. With electrical triggers, large diameter, high voltage transmission line cables must be fed through high field regions. With optical triggers, line-of-sight optics must focus high energy laser beams to the interior of the switches with clean, rigidly-mounted, shock-withstanding optics. This paper reports on efforts to develop fiber-optically triggered photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS) to trigger high voltage switches with improved precision and eliminate the need for large-diameter trigger cables or line-of-sight optics. These triggers simplify design because their optical-isolation allows them to ""float"" with the switches that they trigger and have truly independent EMP-free timing control over 200 micron diameter optical fibers. They improve the performance of prime power switches, diverters, and diagnostics because their low-jitter sub-nanosecond rise times are more precise and more easily adjusted than conventional trigger sources. For pulse charged switches, the PCSS triggers can generally derive their trigger energy from the stray fields of the high voltage switch. Test results will be presented that have demonstrated 100 ps r-m-s jitter from a 40 kV, 500 ps rise time, PCSS-triggered 300 kV trigatron gas gap.

This paper presents experimental results of the horizontal elements investigation, relative to the 3D micro-contacts. Thermal simulations of the proposed structures are also included. This issue is of a great importance, due to the nature of the horizontal elements - actuator type and bending features. The test structures are made electro-chemically of two micro-junction elements: a pin over a chip-carrier and a ring over a substrate-carrier. The tight contact between the pin and the ring during the fitting of micro-junction structures is a guarantee for the electric contact and heat transfer. The thermal optimization of construction-technology parameters of the 3D micro-contacts from stud-ring type is achieved by use of CFD simulations. A 3D numerical model, based on computational fluid dynamics, was constructed to represent the whole package. For the sake of model simplicity, during the modeling procedure it was considered the components that have the most representative size and power dissipation. ©2008 IEEE."

To design and build a prototype outdoor compact substation to withstand internal arc fault and meet all criterion, it needs to predict the arc pressure due to internal arc fault for construction of compact substation. This paper assesses internal arc pressure due to vaporized metal of compact substation in the arc process. Voltage drop of arc is evaluated in order to calculate arc pressure and the value is 22-25 V/cm. Arc energy to vaporize the metal in arc process is found to be 15.5% of three-phase or phase to phase arc energy to vaporize the copper-copper electrodes. The value of 29% of phase to ground arc energy will be used to vaporize the copper electrode and steel housing. Pressure in the compact substation due to internal arc fault is determined and the result is only 5-10% different from the measured values in arcing tests."
512,Parise G.; Martirano L.,Electrical power system in buildings with higher risk for seismic event,2004,Conference Record - IAS Annual Meeting (IEEE Industry Applications Society),"The earthquake can cause serious problems to the functional reliability and continuity of supply of electrical power systems. The paper discusses the need to study the requirements for the design and installation of electrical power systems in buildings subject to seismic hazard. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend mechanical and electrical criteria for the design and the installation, to be graduated according to building occupancy categories (as hospitals, strategic buildings). At least three levels of performances are definable for equipment: -the resistance to the seismic stress, - the guarantee of duty after the earthquake, - the guarantee of duty during and after the earthquake. Basically, the criteria relative to the installation of the electrical equipment are an appropriate extension of those general static ones for non structural components. Their consideration is essential for the settlement of the design criteria, which, as far as the configuration and the size of the electrical power system are concerned, aim at limiting the same installation problems. A special power distribution, ""brush-distribution"", is suitable for the strategic buildings whit higher risk for seismic event This distribution suggests locating, as much as possible, in ground or underground floors the most heavy equipments (transformers, generator sets, motors, panel boards). The electrical loads of building upper floors (inclusive lighting and appliances) has to be subdivided in areas not horizontally in the same level of each floor, but in vertical sectors of the whole building, as ""towers"". Other general design criteria, aimed as a guarantee for the supply continuity, the system reliability and the system protection, have a particular use in these appliances. The paper deals comparing the brush distribution on the basis of the recommendations for the non structural components issued by the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) (edition 2000)."

Sichere energieverteilung auch auf hoher see],2007,BWK - Energie-Fachmagazin,"Air insulated control panels for average voltages are in use in various equipments in shipbuilding and offshore wind energy facilities. For this purpose the facilities must comply with the new control panel standard IEC 62271-200 and the specific ship building standards. The discussion covers introduction; higher requirements because of the new IEC standard 62271-200; higher requirements for the determination of the disturbing electric arc qualification; and unusual features in shipbuilding. Because of the constantly increasing need for performance in energy distribution on luxury liners, container ships, frigates, and other ships, increasingly average voltage grids (ring and radial mains) are used with air insulated control panels and devices in shipbuilding. Typical system voltages are 6.6 and 11 kv. The reasons for the change from low to average voltage grids are because the high nominal or rated currents above 10k amp have short circuit outputs of over 120 k amp at which low voltage control panels reach their natural limits and because of the greater availability and personal safety of air insulated average voltage control panels. Control panels of the Siemens PTD NXAir family have been reworked according to the IEC 62271-200 standard and specific shipbuilding requirements for use on the high seas. They have high reliability because of modular construction with pressure resistant bulkhead partitions, performing transformer principle, and vacuum circuit breakers. They increase the productivity by modular switchgear panel design, selective cut-offs of junction box errors, and inner disturbing electric arc ruggedness. They save on cost with maintenance-free circuit breakers and heavy duty switches, and long maintenance intervals of over 10 yr. The switches on board ships must also withstand vibrations, shocks, climatic conditions, and increased environmental temperatures (45°C). The relevant standards for all of this are in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) norms and the rules of various ship classifications such as the Germanischer Lloyd or Lloyds' Register of Shipping that issue type approval certificates.

These controllers are still under operation and are derived from the modulus of the active power flow in the NS line that is phase-lagged at the frequency of the NS mode and may experience relatively large excursions generated by exogenous disturbances. This paper utilizes the same 1999 data to compare the performance of a proposed robust POD controller design with those of two conventional designs. A recent robust control synthesis algorithm used in this work is based on a nonsmooth optimization technique and has the capability to handle various controller structures, including reduced-order, and to deal with time-domain constraints on both controlled and measured outputs. Moreover, the nonsmooth design technique encompasses multiple operating conditions subject to various test signals, hence building a truly time-domain multi-scenarios approach. According to the results discussed hereafter, this is a key advantage in the industrial context of increasing demand for performance and robustness. The described results relate to a large-scale system model used in the feasibility studies for that interconnection. © 2009 IEEE."

In this lecture the big variety of measures for increasing survivability is demonstrated on the example of the Classification and Construction Rules for Naval Surface Ships of Germanischer Lloyd. In this paper, the different measures taken to consider and improve the survivability of a naval ship in the Rules for Classification and Construction are displayed. Detailed explanations will be given e.g. for the influence on the hull structure, the propulsion system and power supply. Some are shown below: For the hull structure of a ship e.g., residual strength, shock strength, projectile/splinter protection and structural fire protection have to be considered. The Rules give for all influences recommendations for reduction of harmful effects. For the survival of the propulsion system the degree of redundancy of this system as well as of the steering system is of high importance. Therefore GL has developed three special Class Notations. Also power supply and distribution is decisive. GL recommends therefore for large and medium sized combat ships at least two power stations with related switchboards in a distance as far as possible from each other. Other electrical aspects are explosion protection for areas with military vehicles and special stores and the degaussing of the complete ship. ©2006: Royal Institution of Naval Architects."

By virtue of the modular nature of the converter, it is possible to integrate multiple loads and sources with the converter at the same time. The modular construction of the MMCCC topology provides autotransformer-like taps in the circuit, and depending on the conversion ratio of the converter, it becomes possible to connect several dc sources and loads at these taps. The modularity of the new converter is not limited to only this dc transformer (auto) like operation, but also provides redundancy and fault bypass capability in the circuit. Using the modularity feature, some redundant modules can be operated in bypass state, and during some faults, these redundant modules can be used to replace a faulty module to maintain an uninterrupted operation. Moreover, by obtaining a flexible conversion ratio, the MMCCC converter can transfer power in both directions. Thus, this MMCCC topology could be a solution to establish a power management system among multiple sources and loads having different operating voltages. © 2009 IEEE."

They produce high amounts of thermal energy, which claims to have threaten the equipment and to anyone nearby. A single main device should be included, while designing switchboards, switchgears, or substations. Specifying barriers, hinged doors, and insulated bus can be good replacements of switchboards and switchgear as barriers helps in avoiding fault propagation, while hinged doors are said to be safer to open than bolted cover.

Nowadays, various switchgears and substations of this kind are often installed in densely populated areas (for example in buildings for commercial purposes etc.) and may represent a danger associated with their possibly negative influencing of near low current and telecommunication devices as well as living organisms. Because of a lot of various uncertainties in this domain practically all developed countries accepted corresponding standards that, nevertheless, still substantially differ from one another. The unambiguous trend is (at least within the European Union), however, their unification. Manufacturers and operators of the mentioned appliances must certify them, accordingly, i.e. must guarantee the maximum values of field quantities in its neighborhood. This may be realized by either measurements (that is, however, time consuming, expensive and, under common operation conditions, often complicated) or numerical simulations. The latter way -after validating results by experiments - becomes relatively cheap and offers inclusion of optimization techniques. The authors continue in their work where they suggested a methodology of determining magnetic field distribution in the neighborhood of switchgears that consists of several steps. The basics steps are represented by preprocessing (input of 3D geometry), building of 3D mathematical model, its solution (realized by a combination of ANSYS and a number of user procedures) and consequent verification of results. The paper pays attention mainly to the phase ofpreprocessing (selection of the definition area with boundary conditions, parameters of discretization mesh) and solution. Discussed is accuracy of results and also problems concerning measurements and evaluation of the field distribution. The methodology is illustrated on an example - switchgear substation of type WS, manufacturer Areva Sachsenwerk, Germany. The most important results are compared with measured values.

The XPS spectra in the S 2p region of a P3AT self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au were observed at 161.8 (S 2p3/2) and 163.6eV (S 2p3/2). The former was assigned to the sulfur of the thiolate-gold component and the latter to thiophene sulfur. These results indicate that the sulfur head groups in P3AT cause chemical reactions with gold in the self-assembling process. The chemisorption of polythiophene tightly and easily on the metal surface through chemical bonds will pave the way for the construction of good electric contacts and a controllable modification of electronic state on metal surfaces essential for electronic or electrooptical devices such as light-emitting diodes. © 2007 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

Energy savings can be as high as 50% depending on the train speed profile, train car efficiency, and rail resistance. The TCR consists of two parts, power circuit and controller with regulator. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) has implemented TCRs and has proved that the system offers proper regulator work reliably and without oscillations, providing voltage/current within power circuit limitations. While specifying the TCRs, the transportation agencies need to characterize both static and dynamic regulator performance along with power circuit parameters. Upgrading existing silicon diode rectifiers (SDR) substations to RTCR gives substantial energy savings and has a payback of two to two and a half years, improving throughput up to 60% without incurring additional real estate and construction expenses."

Adopting electronic expansion valves enables an appreciable energy saving, due to the fact that electronic valves allow a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped with air cooled condensers, which is adjusted to variations in outside air temperature. Furthermore, superheating at the evaporator is lower and more stable, increasing cooling capacity and decreasing refrigerant temperature at the compressor discharge (the latter ensures better efficiency and lower wear and tear for the compressor). This study is supported by experimental work where the cabinets of a supermarket, located in the northern Italy, have been equipped with both thermostatic and electronic expansion valves, alternatively activated by solenoid valves on a daily basis, in order to compare the two systems in the same environment and at similar load conditions. This allowed the building of a simulation model of the application to evaluate the performance, energy and economic savings in different climates (the energetic analysis considers total electricity consumptions - compressors, fans and electrical switchboards)."

This paper proposes a new integrated product design method for build-to-order production system based products, using the product family concept, which considers product performance, delivery lead-time and inventory cost. The development and discussion of this method uses a switchgear design problem as a concrete and practical design case. A build-to-order production system has been applied to switchgear manufacturing due to its small-scale production and a variety of customer requirements. However, if the risk of maintaining unsold inventory can be decreased, manufacturers can justify holding an amount of versatile inventory. In this paper, inventory production system is applied to the switchgear production problem to shorten the delivery lead-time. The switchgear design and production problem is formulated using three objective functions, which are subassembly procurement lead-time, inventory cost and area occupied by various switchgear configurations. Moreover, to assist inventory cost evaluations, a simulation procedure for the inventory system is proposed. The proposed method is used to obtain a Pareto optimal solution set of the three objective functions. Finally, an example switchgear design problem is solved to illustrate that optimal use of component commonalities across different modules can significantly reduce inventory costs, while also shortening product delivery lead-times.

The annunciator system is an excellent student learning tool because its design and implementation develops and enhances students' knowledge of several interesting and challenging aspects of analog and digital system engineering and signal processing. Only one student (the co-author of this paper) enrolled in the capstone senior design project course offered in fall semester 2007. For her project, the student applied various hardware design techniques to develop and implement an annunciator for a unit of the State of California Department of Water Resources Harvey O. Banks Water Pumping Plant. Since the water pumping unit already exists, the new student-designed annunciator system is designed to operate in compliance with the current setup of the plant. The student-designed annunciator system is designed to be completely compatible with the 13.8 KV switchgear, and to meet other specific requirements. For example, it is suitable for normal operation at 125 V DC and continuous operation over a range of 100-150 V DC. The annunciator system is programmable and expandable to accept up to four different inputs. It also consists of output signals, such as pushbuttons for testing, acknowledging, and resetting the device. The dual-alarm annunciator is wired to terminal blocks at the rear of the annunciator, and uses a flashing light device as well as audible alarm horn to make notifications and provide warnings when the monitored oil level and oil temperature in each water pump deviate from a preset range. These warnings are visible in the window display of the annunciator, and are heard by sounding a loud alarm/buzzer. The student installed the new system into the existing electrical prints, which date back to the 1960s. The design was retested and verified by plant engineers before the installation. The annunciator system project provided the student with in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with designing, developing and testing a sophisticated working system that meets practical real-world engineering requirements, constraints and specifications. The instructor for the capstone design course has suggested similar annunciator design projects to electrical and computer engineering and engineering physics students taking the current (spring semester) offering of the capstone senior design project course, and plans to continue to suggest the project to students in future offerings of the course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2008."

The EML system will need to have fire rates of 6-12 rounds per minute and barrel lifetimes approaching 10,000 rounds, The Naval Research Laboratory has initiated a program to develop and test materials to achieve these fire rates and lifetimes[2], A facility is being assembled to allow testing of rail and armature materials at the high current density, pressure and sliding velocity of the Navy EML. The test system needs to operate over a large range of charging voltages and test configurations. The system also needs to deliver high reliability and reproducibility to accommodate the testing requirements. A 500-kJ module is being designed as the basic building block of the pulsed power system for the facility. Each module will supply up to 100 kA to the materials test system. The components being considered are similar to those proposed for a 200 MJ EML pulsed power system[3]. The capacitors are new, 125 kJ/can, 11-kV units from General Atomics Electronics Systems. The switching thyristors and crowbar diodes are from ABB. A series inductor of approximately 80 μH is used to limit the peak current to 100 kA and isolate modules from each other and to ensure that the current is delivered to the test system. It is expected that the solid-state components used for switching and crowbarring will provide the reliability and flexibility desired for the pulsed power system. The circuit is analyzed with the dynamic nature of the test system included. The rising inductance of the test must be included in the modeling to accurately reflect the action required from the switching and crowbar elements, and the fuses that are in series with capacitors. The physical layout of the banks is also being designed to provide highly compact modules while providing access for maintenance and repair.

Transient Recovery Voltage (TRV) was calculated for conditions of three phase grounding faults for breaking currents larger than 40 kA. The results show that the TRV envelopes stipulated in the current IEC standard could cover most TRV waveforms. First-pole-to-clear factors for the short-circuit current interruption and capacitive current switching do not surpass 1.2. This results from the fact that zero-sequence impedance is being reduced in accordance with recent increases of short-circuit capacity due to expansion of large power sources. These surveys reveal that the IEC standards cover almost all current interrupting stresses on high voltage equipment in 500 kV transmission systems in Japan. 550kV gas insulated switchgear (GIS) with a 10% increased operating voltage above the standard value has been applied to the transmission system with a long-distance transmission lines over 500km in order to stabilize power transmission from a remote sources to urban consuming areas. Operation with an increased operating voltage of 600 kV at remote sources was studied with the conclusion that this practice could reduce the construction costs and power loss. The voltage and current stresses due to increased operating voltage conditions on gas circuit breakers (GCBs) located at each substation were investigated with the conclusion that various 550 kV equipments were available. Additional tests to confirm 550 kV GIS under these severe operating voltage conditions were performed successfully and the GIS has been installed in the field. It will be operated at 600kV when all the construction is finished. Interruption capability of the circuit breaker for the tertiary circuit of a 500 kV transformer is another source of severe stress where TRV tends to be more severe than that of the standard requirements by IEC and JEC. A GCB with a higher rated voltage is usually adopted for this application. Practical simulation analyses have been carried out to optimise design specifications for GCB considering the capacitance of a surge arrester or a capacitive voltage transformer.

The present devices represent minimum-size building-block units for use in near and far-term KrF IFE laser drivers, and they employ on-board optical sources for direct illumination of the silicon thyristor structure. Typical operating parameters for the devices undergoing durability tests are 16.4 kV forward blocking, peak currents of 1.5 to 2.5 kA per cm2, for an 800 ns pulsewidth, and di/dt's of up to 25 kA/usec/cm2. We now have two practical methods for directly illuminating the silicon: through the electrode surfaces as has been practiced for the past 5 years, and a new methodc employing the laser bar arrays in a side-shine geometry. The side-shine geometry provides a more uniform illumination over a larger silicon volume, and can have an advantage in forward losses and durability over the earlier method. It also promises to be a more economical integration than the former. Both versions of the integration are undergoing durability evaluations at this time, with plans to down-select sometime in the next year.

These devices represent minimum-sized building-block units for use in near and far term KrF IFE [2] laser drivers. Testing and iteration continues on the program's limited-area developmental devices in parallel with the scale-up. This allows us to continually evolve some of the more challenging features such as the optical interface and details of the photon sources/drives, while other more mature features are finalized. The scaled-up devices are based on the on-board integrated LGPT, in that the laser diode arrays and their drive electronics are integrated directly into the switch electrode structures. At this time, the on-board approach is still preferred over the fiber-coupled off-board approach, for its ability to produce more photons per unit area active silicon.

The maximum di/dt requirement for the Marx (actually an array of 4 parallel Marxes) is ∼2.7 MA/usec. This is divided among the four parallel units and translates to ∼340 kA/usec for an individual switch, as we plan to use two parallel 5 cm2 devices per Marx current path. Peak current per Marx is ∼35 kA and the current pulse width is an ∼140 nsec half-sine. The devices will have working voltages of from 16.4-16.7 kV and will employ co-planar anti-parallel diodes. In an application where the current pulse width is sub-microsecond, the LGPT's di/dt and current handling are largely determined by the photon fluence.

Another comic elevator song was recorded by African-American group, Butterbeans and Susie where a 1930 song called Elevator Papa, Switchboard Mama"" depicted a married couple composed of an elevator operator and a switchboard operator. Other elevator songs include ""The Elevator Boy"" by songwriter Hal Raynor and Joe Penner and Nan Blakstone's 1947 song ""The Elevator Song"". The ease with which songwriters incorporated elevators into their songs, as well as the use of details of the machines' use in department stores and office buildings, serve as further proof of the cultural importance of this technology."

575,Thomas P.,Biodegradable dielectric liquids for transformer applications,2005,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Electrical Insulating Materials,"Mineral oil which is a derivative of petroleum crude is used in transformers, capacitors, switchgears and in circuit breaker from the beginning. There are nearly 1500 different types of crudes are produced around the world which differ from one another in chemical composition. These mineral oils are less fire resistant, non- biodegradable, poor oxidation stability and toxic in nature. Hence there was a need for the development of high fire resistant and biodegradable fluids. The Polychlorinated biphenyls were introduced as non-flammable , high chemical stability synthetic liquids for transformers, capacitors, and for switchgear. But the discovery in late 1960's reveals that they are not friendly towards the environment and they are extremely toxic. Since PCB's are not friendly towards environment , they have been banned [2] The worldwide depletion of petroleum crudes and alternative to Polychlorinated biphenyls has stimulated the pattern of research and evaluation of hydrocarbons, Esters both natural and synthetic in respect of characteristics to suit electrical applications. A number of synthetic dielectric liquids such as silicone oil, organic esters and aromatic hydrocarbons in place of PCB's were developed and are being used in a variety of electrical applications because of their fire-resistance, thermal stability & high dielectric behavior [3]. Esters developed by chemically modifying the vegetable fatty acids are the only fluids non-toxic and are completely biodegradable. These liquids has long-term oxidation and hydrolytically stable. It is very essential to use such biodegradable , non toxic dielectric fluids for transformer applications. Not only it is important for a dielectric fluid to be biodegradable, but it should not pollute the ecosystem by giving out any hazardous materials. When transformers located close proximity to the rivers, canals, sewage treatment work spots, high rise buildings, hospitals and educational institutions, risk is minimized my using fire resistant, biodegradable, non-toxic dielectric fluids. This will ensure that the ecosystem is clean, free from toxic contaminant for the better life. CPRI has undertaken research work on these area to cater to the needs for the Indian systems."
576,Krieg T.; Steindl M.,Coping with major growth-Implications for substation design,2008,"42nd International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2008, CIGRE 2008","Ergon Energy is a government owned and regulated distribution utility with network assets in the voltage range from 415V to 220kV, covering an area of 1. 7 million square kilometres or 97% of the area of Queensland, Australia. A relatively young organisation, Ergon Energy was formed in 1999 from 6 regionally based distribution companies; it has been challenged to deliver electrical supply to a small but growing customer base, supporting a booming mining and industrial customer base in a range of environmental conditions including arid as well as tropical cyclonic areas. Record high capital expenditure required to meet the growing energy demands of a rapidly expanding population has meant a review of the traditional approach to substation design and the process for delivery of new substations. This paper describes the new processes adopted and also some of the spin-off innovations that have been an outcome of the design standard review process. The change to approach in design standards was achieved with a major business change initiative project, formed to develop a new top-down and structured approach to substation design and this project identified the following key stages: Setting a vision and direction for new substation design based on the future infrastructure requirements for the organisation; Establishment of a range of concept designs to meet the broad needs identified in the vision; Implementation of the new approach to substation design templates; Continuous improvement and review A non-traditional standards documentation approach was adopted by the development of standard designs and associated design template drawings to be used by designers for all new substation development, reducing the site by site design engineering design requirements and minimising project delivery time. Establishment of an integrated set of designs enabled the use of long term supplier contracts and the adoption of alternative construction contracting models all targeted at reducing project delivery time. Base design concepts and associated templates were developed that covered the capital requirements for Network augmentation for the foreseeable future. These designs include a range of options and features for planners and designers including: Pre-assembled modular or alternative brick buildings; Fast deployment, self contained ""skid-based"" designs; Indoor and outdoor switchgear options with use of both air insulated and Gas insulated indoor switchgear options; A limited range of transformer sizes with design options for large and small loads; Design integration across the entire range for ease of construction, maintenance and operations; Integration of design concepts to ensure expandability for future growth without compromising design integrity. Implementation of the new design approach identified a number of staff challenges, not-theleast that some design staff believed that design roles were substantially reduced by the use of standardised designs reducing engineering effort required on a site by site basis. Development of a detailed design for a substation project now includes site configuration and design verification rather than development of a detailed design optimised to the site and network topology. Innovation was evident in the project process undertaken and a number of new initiatives were introduced to the business. One of these initiatives was the development of a fully mobile, voltage and vector group selectable 10 MVA mobile substation, designed to provide support for the large proportion of single transformer and reduced contingency substations in the network thus enabling deferral of capital expenditure and ability to perform crucial maintenance without interrupting customer load. In addition a number of new management processes have been introduced to ensure that innovation and continuous improvement opportunities were available for all standard designs. In summary, the new approach to substation design standards that was developed and implemented by Ergon Energy provides a range of integrated options for network planners, reducing design, construction and delivery time and reducing cost. The implementation of alternative network augmentation solutions including the use of modular, self-contained standardised substations enables rapid load growth to be accommodated without sacrificing a common design approach that may otherwise have operational and longer term implications."

But most of these methods are too complicated and expensive to be used widely, many kinds of lights, such as corona, surface sparkle, sunlight, lamp light, electric torch light as well as arc light, are researched. The characteristic of arc light is found via a series of light sense tests, therefore the single criterion of arc is adopted. On this basis, an optic fiber sensor for arc light is developed. Finally, a practical multi-point distributed online detecting and protection system for internal faults arc is researched and developed. This system is economic with simple construction, high anti-jamming capacity and very short action time; it can not only be used separately, but also be integrated with various existing digital relay protection systems, therefore the technology level and added value of switchgear can be enhanced while the cost only increases a little."

Compactness in fact means that less floor space is required and makes it possible to install the switchgear as close as possible to energy users in urban centres, thus minimising losses. It also leads to a reduction in the cost of materials used for construction, building and civil works. Reliability ensures that there are no operating stoppages and no additional costs due to non-distribution of energy. Overall, optimised compactness and reliability reduce costs and environmental impacts over the life time of a product. The strategies and methods used to achieve compactness and reliability in the design and development of new gas insulated switchgear (GIS) with a rated voltage of 420 kV are described. They firstly involve the digital simulation methods that are now used to model the hydrodynamic behaviour of the electric arc in the event of fault current breaking. They also involve the use of advanced optical technologies in the design of measuring transformers. It is shown that the constant reduction in the energy required to operate high-voltage circuit breakers has also made it possible to use a low-energy mechanical drive for the new 420 kV circuit breaker. The new bay controllers have additional functions that will prevent incidents and allow various maintenance strategies to be implemented. The results of the life cycle assessment summarise, from the environmental point of view, all the implications related to the compactness and reliability of this new switchgear assembly. Significant reductions in environmental impact have in fact been achieved as a result of the considerable reduction in materials, emissions to air and energy consumption and loss. The interpretation of the life cycle assessment reveals that they are key factors for GIS, which has a useful life of at least forty years."

580,Znidarich M.M.,Hydro generator high voltage stator windings: Part 2 - Design for reduced copper losses and elimination of harmonics,2009,Australian Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering,"Hydro generator stator winding design is one of the key factors when considering machine upgrades and uprates. The hydro generators built 30-50 years ago employed stator insulation systems with lower voltage stresses and correspondingly larger insulation allowances. Modern insulation systems use thinner, more homogenous insulations, which permit higher voltage stresses, while providing much improved thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation. There is therefore quite a scope for the high voltage (HV) stator winding designer to increase overall coil copper content by between 20-40%, which often provides copper losses at increased output not much higher than the losses produced by the existing winding at pre-uprate machine rating. In conjunction with the new insulation improved thermal dissipation, it is possible to design uprated windings with temperature rises similar to the existing ones. The main focus of the HV coil design for hydro generator upgrades and uprates is therefore reduction of copper losses, and optimisation of thermal characteristics for best dissipation of heat losses. The loads connected to the hydro generator terminals (transformers, transmission lines, switchgear, etc.) are all designed to operate with pure sinusoidal EMF (Walker, 1981). The purity limits of the generators' open circuit wave are prescribed by the standards (AEMC, 2008). Given the salient pole construction of hydro generator rotor with large variation of magnetic permeance in direct and quadrature axes, and the concentrated nature of rotor field pole windings, special measures are implemented on the geometry of rotor pole face. They include pole face shaping for sinusoidal approximation of rotor MMF, and adjustment of damper winding geometry relative to the slotted periphery of stator bore for reduction of the slot ripples (Walker, 1981). Given the relatively slow hydro generator operational speeds and necessarily large number of poles, the stator winding consists of large numbers of pole phase groups having only a few coils (typically 1 to 3). The stator winding MMF will therefore be rather coarse, and special measures must be implemented to achieve the output waveform as close to a pure sinusoid as possible. This second of four papers on hydro generator stator windings (refer to Znidarich, 2008a, Znidarich, 2009b, and Znidarich, 2009c) describes some tools at the hydro generator stator winding designer's disposal for effective reduction of harmonics and optimisation of output waveform purity. They include skewing of stator core slots, fractional (short) pitching of stator winding coils and fractional slot windings. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2009."

582,Bai H.; Zhao Z.,Dynamic equivalent circuit design in three-level high voltage inverters based on functional model of IGCT,2007,Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC,"The integrated gate commutated thyristors (IGCTs) are commonly used for construction of high voltage three-level PWM controlled voltage source converter/inverters. When the output voltage is greater than the maximum rated voltage, IGCTs are connected in series. To ensure the safe and reliable operation of the converter/inverters, special measures are required to equalize the voltages across the IGCTs connected in series. An effective method for balancing voltages is to use resistors for static voltage balancing and RC snubber circuits for dynamic voltage balancing. However, most of the previous research work reported in the literature focused on the dynamic circuit design for converters of the BUCK topology. Trade off is made only between the performance of dynamic voltage balancing and the turn-on loss without any consideration of di/dt endurance and any procedural steps, which makes the design procedure not suitable for converters of the three-level topology. Based on a functional model of IGCTs, this paper presents a procedure for optimum design of the dynamic voltage balancing circuit for a 6 kV/1250 kW inverter. The specific transient processes in the three-level topology with dynamic snubber circuit are simulated and the mechanisms are analyzed, which is absent in the previous work. ©2007 IEEE."

One of the most complex challenges confronted by today's project managers is cost controlling and project schedule overruns. A well organized project planning and cost control system is needed. An effective cost and schedule control system must be established in order to deliver the construction projects on time and within the budget. Such a system should provide the information needed for the whole project team so that the actual performance can be compared to planned performance in a format that will provide a valid, timely picture of the project status, while problem areas that require particular attention can be isolated and looked into individually. To manage a project effectively, you need to communicate and distribute project information.

598,Khayam U.; Ohtsuka S.; Matsumoto S.; Hikita M.,Partial discharge and cross interference phenomena in a three-phase construction,2009,International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics,This paper deals with partial discharge measurement and partial discharge characteristics on a three-phase construction. A simplified model of three-phase gas insulated switchgear is used in the experiment to simulate three-phase electric field in three-phase equipment. A particle was adhered on the different positions on the conductor and on the tank to produce partial discharge. Partial discharge signals flowing on three phase conductors were measured simultaneously with three high frequency current transformers clamped on the threephase lines through capacitive voltage divider. Partial discharge signals induced on the enclosure were measured with the current transformer and the detecting impedance. The circuit was calibrated and examined by injecting known charges from a pulse calibrator to some points in the circuit. The calibration results indicate that measuring partial discharge signals only at the enclosure or on one of the phases of three phase construction will result in the position dependent sensitivity for partial discharges. Experimental results show that partial discharge inception voltages of a particle adhered on different position differed depended on the particle position. Phase of partial discharge inception voltage also depended on the particle position. Experimental results show that partial discharge caused by a particle on one phase conductor was induced and detected on the other phase conductors. Polarity and magnitude of discharge current flowing on each phase depended on the particle position. Each particle at different position generated discharge current which flowed on each phase so that the magnitude ratios of the currents flowing on each phase were unique for each particle. These results were discussed with considering electric field characteristic in three-phase construction and coupling capacitance between three-phase conductors and between the conductors and the tank.
599,Renton A.,Substation design using phase to phase insulation,2006,"41st International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2006, CIGRE 2006","The use of phase to phase insulation on Transmission Systems appears to have been limited to use as conductor spacers to prevent line clashing on transmission circuits. Further applications within transmission systems and in particular switchyards, do not appear to have been pursued. While investigating expansion options for a 220 kV substation, we found that by using a higher voltage class composite insulator to separate the main and transverse bus sections, a number of advantages over current designs are possible. These ideas can be used for both the redevelopment of existing and the construction of new substations. Work was carried out to investigate expansion options at a 220 kV substation. The brief for this review involved examining the existing switchyard designs and suggesting possible options that would meet the following key design criteria; •Reduced site visual impact •Elimination of special components •Utilisation of standard Air Insulated Switchgear (AIS) and line hardware •Utilisation of AIS equipment from alternative suppliers •Compliance with clients seismic and electrical clearance design standards One design option that evolved made use of a rigid aluminium main busbar separated from the flexible (stranded conductor) transverse bus by phase to phase insulation, made up of a standard 400 kV composite line suspension insulator hung from the main bus. This approach enabled the design criteria objectives to be met primarily by reducing the number of components used. By changing the design of the main bus supports, savings in foundations and structures were also realised. With the use of a larger diameter main bus, the requirement for rigid transverse buswork and associated support posts, foundations and insulators was removed as the suspended composite insulator strings support the transverse bus conductor. As an added advantage this arrangement enabled the physical spacing of the transverse bus and the main bus support structures to be reduced without affecting electrical clearances, resulting in a shorter and narrower bay size. Taken together this arrangement has enabled the following; •Fewer components to be utilised, with no special or one supplier only parts being required as the flexible transverse bus acts as both transverse bus and equipment connector •Reduced number of structures to be installed and maintained •Improved access to the switchyard through the removal of clutter and extraneous structures •Reduced construction time & cost savings of approximately 55-80% per bus section •Improved environmental effects by reducing the station footprint and visual impact with fewer structures being present •Improved equipment maintenance access This paper describes the design of this alternative approach, and compares and contrasts technical and financial attributes with more traditional designs."

In order to meet the increasing demand for electric power in the metropolitan area, long-distance 500 kV XLPE cable lines were planned and the development of 500 kV XLPE cable and joint was commenced. The goals were a reduction in the insulation thickness and achieving higher reliability. It took six years for the development, from investigating those factors that affect performance and deterioration characteristics to validation of the cable's performance in a full-scale installation. Followed by the development, construction of the Shin-Toyosu Line, the world's first long-distance 500 kV XLPE cable line, was begun in 1995 and commissioned in November 2000."

Radiometric sensors are designed as direct detection receivers with input low noise amplifiers [1] Input amplifier is realized on the basis of three monolithic amplifying ICs connected in series. The first stage is realized using low-noise IC ALH369 (TRW), the second and the third stages are realized on the basis of CHA2094 (UMS). Shottky diode HSCH-9161 (HP) was used as square-law detector. The output low frequency amplifier is realized on the basis of IC OP27GS. The use of low noise monolithic ICs has made it possible to achieve small sizes and high sensitivity of the sensors. Within the operating frequency band 31⋯38 GHz the sensors have temperature sensitivity better than 10 mK/Hz1/2 in total power mode. Through low pass filters and analog switchboard, signals from sensor output comes to 12-digits ADC, which converts the output signals into digital code for the following processing. Block-diagram of 32-channels array is shown in Fig. 1. The sensors have a stretched configuration that facilitates their arrangement within array structure. Waveguide input of each sensor is connected directly to its feed, which receives the signal from certain direction. The sensors are attached to two metal plates, on both sides of each plate, thus forming two-dimensional array 4×8. All sensors are packaged in such a way that its feeds are placed in focal plane of the main antenna and directed towards antenna center. Flat-convex lens was used as the main antenna. The lens has diameter 600 mm and allows to form beams with 0.9 degree width at 3 dB level. The lens is made of hard polyethylene which has dielectric constant ε = 2,38 and losses tg δ = 2-10-4. In order to minimize distortion of periphery beams the lens was designed long focal (F = 660 mm). In spite of large weight lens antennas are more suitable for array receiver system due to absence of shade effect that is especially important when arrays with big number of sensors are used. Dielectric rods were used as feeds of the main antenna. Small transverse sizes of the rods give possibility to arrange the sensors closer to each other. The feeds along with the main antenna form 4 vertical rows of beams (8 beams in each row). The distance between adjacent beams in each row is 1.4 degrees. At scanning in a horizontal plane, receiver beams register 32 horizontal strips with angular distance 0,35 degrees between the middle of adjacent strips. Receiver array with feeds and lens antenna are rigidly fixed relatively each other. Presented in Fig. 2 is the construction of designed receiver camera. The given camera allows to scan a surveyed scene 32 times faster comparing with a single receiver sensor. Thus, 32 channels receiver camera operating in 8 mm waveband is developed. During one scan the camera is capable to provide an image with good angular resolution. The further perfecting of the imaging systems require to increase the number of receiver sensors and diameter of antenna to the greatest possible levels. © 2003 IEEE."
612,Yan J.-T.; Hsiao P.-Y.,Minimizing the number of switchboxes for region definition and ordering assignment,1996,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,"For a building block placement, the routing space will be fully defined into channels and switchboxes because the definition of switchboxes releases all the cycles in a channel precedence graph and further yields a safe routing ordering. However, switchhox routing is more difficult than channel routing. Due to the requirements in the routing phase, it is important for us to minimize the number of switchboxes in the definition of channels and switchboxes. In this paper, a region definition and ordering assignment (RDAOA) algorithm on minimizing the number of switchboxes is proposed. First, the routing space is modeled as a floorplan graph. According to the routing precedence in one ""T"" type junction, the graph is further transformed into a channel precedence graph. Hence, the problem of minimizing the number of switchboxes in region definition will correspond to the minimum feedback vertex set (MFVS) problem in the channel precedence graph. Second, based on the cyclic properties in a channel precedence graph, the MFVS problem is solved by the minimal-cycle phase and the long-cycle phase. All the minimal cycles and most of the long cycles are broken in the minimal-cycle phase, and the remaining long cycles are further broken in the long-cycle phase. As a result, fewer switchboxes are defined, and these channels and switchboxes are assigned to guarantee a safe routing ordering. The time complexity of the algorithm is proved to be in O(n) time, where n is the number of line segments in a given floorplan graph. Finally, several examples have been tested on the proposed algorithm and other published algorithms, and the experimental results show that our algorithm defines fewer switchboxes than other algorithms. © 1996 IEEE."

Under such circumstances, in December 2003, a 1,000-MW coal-fired power plant with the world's highest efficiency - Unit No. 1 of Hitachinaka Thermal Power Station of The Tokyo Electric Power Co., Inc. - was put into service. This generator consists of a coal-fired boiler with an extremely high critical pressure and a main steam temperature of 600°C as well as a state-of-the-art steam turbine with 41-inch-long (about 104 cm) final-stage turbine blades. Hitachi, Ltd. was in charge of the design and construction of the facilities for these two main components (i.e. the boiler and turbine) of Unit No. 1. Upon completing the plant design, Hitachi drew upon its collective strengths and latest technologies to develop these components. That is, by introducing the large-capacity, coal-fired boiler -which can handle many varieties of coal and meet the optimum steam conditions through increased pressure and temperature - and the high-efficiency steam turbine, both plant efficiency and reliability have been improved. Furthermore, a newly developed remote-monitoring system installed in the central control room of the plant utilizes expanded-display devices [large-size LCD (liquid crystal display) displays] and wider-scope operation by means of highly functional CRT (cathode ray tube) displays. As a result of this system set-up, plant operation in terms of labor saving and monitorability is improved. In addition, the remote-monitoring system is directly connected to the switchgear for auxiliary electrical equipment; consequently, the amount of cable materials used is reduced and the construction cost is lowered."

A discussion covers an analysis of the National Electrical Code (NEC) rules for Cabling and Cable Systems for Hazardous (Classified) Locations based on the experience at the Monsanto Chemical facilities, but includes observations from other facilities, particularly a plant using the zone system; application of the NEC wiring rules; the distinct safety advantages of cable/cable tray systems; and a case history of an incident that occurred due to the difficulty in applying the NEC rules, e.g., an explosion demolished a switchgear building at an LNG marine importation terminal."

Such normalization has led to significant gains in recognition accuracy by reducing variability among speakers and allowing the pooling of training data and the construction of sharper models. But standard methods for determining the warp scale have been extremely cumbersome, generally requiring multiple recognition passes. We present a new system for warp scale selection which uses a simple generic voiced speech model to rapidly select appropriate frequency scales. The selection is sufficiently streamlined that it can moved completely into the front-end processing. Using this system on a standard test of the Switchboard Corpus, we have achieved relative reductions in word error rates of 12% over unnormalized gender-independent models and 6% over our best unnormalized gender-dependent models."

Wet etching was used to create cavities in the MgO substrate of high Tc BiPbSrCaCuO films. Processes for lithography of metal patterns on superconductor films were also devised. It was found that cavities with a wall angle of 55 - 60° could be formed in (100) MgO using solutions of HNO3:CH 3COOH or H3PO4. The MgO normal etch rates of these solutions were found to be respectively 117 and 27μm/hour. Thermal evaporation and magnetron rf sputtering were used to prepare Au and Ag films on BiPbSrCaCuO and MgO; however, only the sputtered films showed adequate film adhesion. Electric contacts and dipoles made of Au or Ag could be created by wet etching in a solution of KI-I without apparent degradation of the superconductivity of BiPbSrCaCuO. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."

These should be considered in the design to avoid the burning effect which is common when the occurrence of electric arc is not suppressed. A switchgear that solves the problem of an open arc due to internal fault is presented. It has very fast acting arc eliminator that makes a direct short circuit in parallel with the arc which distinguishes within 10 ms. This action time is short enough to reduce the pressure rise and the thermal stress caused by the arc to avoid damage on the equipment and handle several faults."

Mechanically, the building's configuration requires large ducts and that in turn complicates coordination of the electrical system in the ceilings. Since building codes do not specifically address this type of facility, a design process that required close cooperation among the owner, design team, building officials, and fire officials was formulated.

The requirements to the reliability of VSDS in such applications are extraordinarily high. In this paper, a comparison of the potential reliability for a number of different high-power medium-voltage drive concepts is made, like load commutated inverters, voltage source inverters, and cellular converters based on building blocks. Redundancy is introduced as a means of increasing reliability, and different approaches to redundancy in a VSDS are discussed.

644,Parekh N.,Case studies on accidents & preventive measures,2000,Proceedings of 2000 IEEE IAS Workshop on Electrical Safety in Industry,"There are various types of electrical accidents in industries. Many accidents in the construction industry happen due to poor earthing, temporary repairs and insufficient protection. In the HT and LT switchgear installed in substations, main causes of accidents are design/assembly defects, faulty/partial isolation, overconfidence, hurry to complete the job etc. In industries dealing with hydrocarbons, rubber, PE sheets etc, static charge is generated during processing or product handling. Lack of earthing or poor earthing becomes main reason of fire, shock or explosion. In such industries, earthing and bonding become very essential. Apart from all other factors, human factor is very important. Therefore, sufficient knowledge and safety awareness in the personnel working with electricity are very essential. Even in the domestic field, many accidents take place due to lack of basic knowledge about Electricity. The paper presented discusses five case studies of industry. Investigation and preventive measures are also discussed in each case. © 2000, IEEE. All rights reserved."

Since then manufacturers have embraced the need to concentrate on this aspect of switchgear performance and a number of methods for mitigating against internal faults are now well established. The paper will discuss these which include lowering the risk of occurrence of a fault through careful choices of materials and design approach, pressure relief for tanks and chambers and the use of various types of fault detectors to trigger circuit-breakers of fault diverters. Attention will also be paid to the design of buildings for housing switchgear to optimise their response under fault situations. Progress has been made in refining methods of test, particularly in respect of tests for early development and for building assessment; these methods will be presented. Theoretical methods for predicting pressure rise will be discussed briefly, looking at the applicability of the various approaches rather than dealing with one particular approach in detail. In the UK the industry's viewpoint is expressed by EATS 41-26 which adds specific requirements for conditions and methods of test. Manufacturers have been able to satisfy these requirements - the paper will discuss how this has been achieved and will present the views of a manufacturer and a user on approaches currently in use. The paper will also examine alternative options for the future together with assessments of the suitability of each of these in various types of application."
646,Bitterlin I.F.,Comparative reliability analysis of the AC voltage supply to critical microprocessor loads in alternative power architectures,2002,"INTELEC, International Telecommunications Energy Conference (Proceedings)","Many manufacturers of critical power equipment, such as UPS, publish ""reliability"" data for their products in the form of an MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure). Allied with an estimate of the MDT (Mean Down Time) or MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), which should include an element of ""travel time"" which reflects the anticipated reaction time of the service organization to respond to a site emergency, a simple calculation can produce the commonly used (and often abused) criteria of ""reliability"" - that of Availability. Only a minority of manufacturers produce this MTBF data from actual field measurement or experience. When redundant power architectures are taken into account these ""theoretical"" module MTBF's can be used to generate system level MTBF's of such magnitude that the absolute value is meaningless, or, at best, unimaginable. Claims for UPS system MTBF's of more than 100 times the plant life expectancy are commonplace. So, does this mean that such calculations are of no use? Not necessarily, if used with care. This paper attempts to show that reliability calculation techniques, such as the Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) method, can be effectively used as a tool for ""comparison"" of alternative power architectures. Building from basic principles, many models for sub-sets of the power train (between MV supply network and the LV load terminals) can be developed - whilst the inherent dangers of over-simplifying the RBD's (making them ""look"" like the single line diagram of the plant that they model) are highlighted with examples. Examples will be applied to single and dual-bus power distribution systems to show the direct relationship between high levels of Availability and the capital investment required. Theoretical MTBF data, provided by manufacturers of UPS systems in particular, rarely, if ever, take into account the switchgear and cabling infrastructure that connects it into the power system. This paper will show the dramatic effect of taking a more realistic approach to N+I to N+N redundancy architectures. Lastly, a rather more holistic approach, between the power supplied and the heat extraction system required, will be applied to the overall reliability of the ""technical space""."

In this study a centralised and a decentralised network were designed in order to compare them economically and technically. The network of the Kirkniemi (Lohja, Finland) power plant was used as a model case. The emphasis of this study was on economical aspects, but also the most important technical aspects were considered. The decentralised network requires less space and less cabling since there is no switchgear building and distribution transformers are placed closer to the consumption. Medium voltage motors and distribution transformers build up a ring. Less cabling and an absent switchgear building cause considerable savings. Component costs of both of the networks were estimated by using data from completed power plant projects. Component costs of the decentralised network were smaller than those of the centralised network. An essential question of the network is the relay protection and associated fault location. Simulations for the decentralised network were done in order to find a way to carry out earth fault protection and location. It was found out that in high resistance earthed system the fault distance can be estimated by a relatively simple method. The decentralised network uses a field bus, which offers many new features to the automation system of a power plant. Many-sided information can be collected from the protection devices in order to schedule maintenance duties at the right time. Through the field bus it is also possible to control remotely a power plant. The decentralised network is built up from ready-to-install modules. These modules are tested by the module manufacturer, which reduces the need for field testing dramatically. The workload needed in the project management and engineering of a power plant drops also due the modules. During the lifetime of a power plant, maintenance is easier and more economical."

Wires were deliberately ignited in each cubicle and the results recorded. Measurements of the effects of emissions on the contact resistance of control devices were made, and the relative ease of cleaning was checked. A comparison of the results shows that the low-emissions wire did reduce the effects of the fire on both internal appearance of the equipment and on the contact resistance of control devices."

The precursors of switches were contact devices, which were only gradually developed to form circuit breakers. Vacuum and switchgear technology went their separate ways to a long time. Various technologies, all of which failed to a greater or lesser extent, characterized the time up to around 1960. Only then did any interdisciplinary development take place. This is the time of the 'marriage'. The result to today's maintenance-free high performance circuit breakers, which are designed for long life.

The harmonics were monitored from the building switchboard using purpose-designed hardware. The PCs were set to execute four types of processing mode: idle, numerical processing, floppy, and hard disk accesses. The results recorded were indicative of harmonics caused by the PC box only; secondary effects of harmonic production caused by distorted supply voltages were avoided. The results show that hard disk accesses cause the highest level of harmonic production affecting the 3rd and 5th components. Harmonic attenuation was very apparent when comparing the results between a single PC and 124 PCs connected to the same supply phase. However, attenuation and diversity effects due to changes in loading level on the PC power supply were not as predicted, showing an increase in harmonic generation with line current rms level."

The decentralised network is more economical than a conventional model of the network and a separate switchgear building no needed. This enables to design difference and better layout than before. Earth fault accurate location in the decentralised network is challenging problem. One potential method to earth fault location is measure sumcurrent from three difference points of the decentralised network. Earth fault location can define on account of measured sumcurrents magnitude. It is conceivable to use measured sumcurrents in a selective protection of devices in network, for instance motors and transformers. In this study the earth fault of the decentralised network were simulated. The network of the Kirkniemi (Lohja, Finland) power plant was used as a model case. Earth fault location was carried out at a table format. The table has in advance calculated theoretical sumcurrent values when the earth faults happened anywhere on the network. Theoretical sumcurrent values and simulated values were compared. An estimation of the location was defined on account of least squares of error. Accuracy of the location was around one meter with carried out solution algorithm. Value of point formed direct capacities to ground has an essentially bearing on accuracy of the location. Measuring accuracy of currents has an essentially bearing on accuracy in practice too."

This type of switchgear is mostly placed in densely populated areas or in public buildings (factories, apartment buildings, department stores, etc. ) The goal of this study was to answer the question if the current regulations for high-voltage switchgear (50 kV and higher) in the Netherlands could be applicable to MV switchgear. The study was carried out in four stages; a survey among a number of manufacturers of MV SF//6; a literature study into the decomposition products of SF//6 and other electrotechnical insulating materials; measurements inside and outside a standard concrete transformer station of the decreasing SF//6 concentration due to the existing natural ventilation and, finally, calculations of the concentration of SF//6 and/or its main decomposition product (SOF//2) to be expected inside a building in case of an undesirable expulsion of SF//6 from the switchgear. The study shows that, in comparison with non-SF//6-insulated systems, the SF//6-insulated MV switchgear does not involve any greater risk for human beings and the environment due to the formation of harmful gases and vapors."

A power system general optimization process methodology is suggested, especially usable in all the cases in which the system's 'architecture' is an actual project variable. It is shown how the maximum and minimum short circuit current values may be the main factors determining the selection of circuit ratings. During power system design the best procedure seems to be that which from the short circuit level on the main switchboard leads to a selection of circuit ratings also on the basis of the distances of estimate loads sets. By iterating this procedure, the 'architecture' of the system is adapted to the specific cases."

These wires and cables have been available for general building wire for several years, but not as Type SIS wire, which is required by ANSI/IEEE standards for use in switchgear equipments. Now Type SIS wire insulated with low smoke, low emission, halogen-free material is available. To investigate the performance of this wire under fire conditions, two identical equipments were built, one wired with standard SIS wire and one with low-emissions SIS wire. Wires were deliberately ignited in each cubicle and the results recorded. Measurements of the effects of emissions on the contact resistance of control devices were made, and the relative ease of cleaning was checked. A comparison of the results shows that the low-emissions wire did reduce the effects of the fire on both internal appearance of the equipment and on the contact resistance of control devices."

The new method of Auto-Bonding relies on the generation of a bonding material from within the lignocellulosic material. The auto-bonding effect is achieved by first subjecting the lignocellulosic material to thermal hydrolysis which selectively and chemically converts the hemicellulose portion of the lignocellulosic material into low molecular weight water soluble carbohydrates and other decomposition products as the resin binder. Then the bonding is achieved by subjecting the lignocellulosic material under heat and pressure to polymerize and thermoset the resin binder in situ to produce a panelboard with strong mechanical strength and good dimensional stability. The panel boards thus produced are boil-proof and surpass the Canadian National Standard of exterior grade for construction use. The absence of formaldehyde emission also makes the binderless panels particularly appropriate for indoor use. Wood material and agricultural waste, such as sugarcane bagasse, cereal straw, cotton stalks, rice husks, etc. can all be utilized for the manufacture of binderless panelboards. The elimination of expensive, synthetic, petrochemically based resin adhesives makes this new method economically attractive for commercial development."

This paper deals with the supply of electrical energy to a particular type of launcher, a linear induction launcher (LIL). The LIL consists of an array of coils, forming the barrel, and a conducting cylinder (sleeve) enveloping the payload. The coils of the barrel are grouped into sections and are energized in polyphase fashion by capacitor banks, through appropriate switch gear. The polyphase excitation is designed to create an electromagnetic wave packet that travels with fixed velocity in each section, but with increasing velocity down the barrel. The relative motion (slip) of the wave packet with respect to the sleeve induces in it azimuthal currents that interact with the exciting magnetic field to product propulsion and levitation (centering) force. The development of the power modulator is based on the following specifications: projectile mass of 250 gr., muzzle velocity of 2 W s , and peak voltage of 40 kV. These specifications lead to performance requirements for the most stressed components, the switches, as listed in Table 1. The design of the power modulator for the gun is based ON imparting short duration increments of pulse energy to the projectile at precise times during its travel down the barrel. This design requires 24 individual modulators that are charged in parallel and then programmed to discharge at selected times. Development of such a modulator can be met by using 24 eparate RLC circuits that are individually switched. Currently, we are evaluating components and circuits for such a pulser. A universal test module has been constructed which enables us to evaluate state of the art components over a wide range of voltages, currents, and energies. Since component cost and commercial availability will have a strong bearing on the construction of the system in the 1993-1994 time frame the evaluation concentrated on components that offer a compromise between cost and life while meeting the technical requirements and operation constraints. The single shot test module is resistively charged and can be operated from 0-40 kV. Capacitance can be varied from 25- 1225 microfarads by series and or parallel connection of 7 each 175 microfarads capacitors rated for 22 kV. Inductance can be varied from 3 to 1200 microhenries by series and or parallel connection of ten (10) 60 microhenry inductors. Switches evaluated to date include ignitrons models BK-514 and NL 8900 and the ST-300 spark gap. Circuit designs for terminating a current pulse are also being investigated. Results obtained at voltages up to 20 kV and peak currents up to 30 kA for underdamped oscillations at frequencies up to 10 kilohertz will be presented. © 1992 IEEE."
767,Nishida Isao; Ono Masatomo; Kurosawa Yukio,Improvement of SF6 GIS to cope with the progressing transmission technology,1991,Hitachi Review,"GIS (Gas-Insulated Switchgear) is the most popular of all kinds of high voltage switchgears nowadays. Its advantages include compactness, high reliability and low maintenance. The development of GIS has been carried out with compactness as the principal consideration, including the reduction of the number of breaks in the GCB (Gas Circuit Breaker). The recent increase in power demand necessitates the construction of high voltage and large capacity substations in urban areas, making compactness extremely important for environmental harmony and reduction of construction cost even for the extra-high voltage equipment. To cope with these demands, 300-kV all three-phase common tank GIS and 550-kV three-phase common tank busbar have been developed. Improvement of reliability through the use of external detective technology, including many kinds of sensors, is also being pursued."

GIS was selected for this station because of required substation reliability, known environmental sensitivity, and potential area seismicity. The economic studies which preceded the selection of GIS for this station indicated that the differential in installed cost between GIS and air insulated equipment favored GIS.

There is a wide range of imminent particles since heavy and light particles are included. The presence of conducting particles in the case of a conic spacer insulator also causes a hazard to insulation due to overvoltages appearing in service.

The topics discussed are auto reclosers, sectionalisers, and system automation. The World's first pole mounted SF6 auto-recloser with microprocessor control, the Brush type PMR, was introduced in 1983. A third generation microprocessor based relay has been introduced to offer an enhanced performance in terms of settings, simplicity of use and facilities which include fault history in terms of fault current level and type, together with information on battery voltage and remaining contact life. Sectionalisers are fault-make, load break automatic switches which are specifically designed to operate downstream from auto-reclosers and are able to co-ordinate with them under both phase and earth fault conditions. System automation in Loop systems presents a problem to auto-reclosers in that the design of the normal autorecloser demands that the power source be on one side only. To overcome this, and allow greater flexibility, the Brush PMR auto-recloser can be provided with a low voltage mechanism solenoid which will allow the power source to be on either side. The Brush PMS Sectionaliser now has the option of construction as a switch with remote operation via an integral low voltage motor wound spring operating mechanism."

This paper describes the process observed. ranging from contact failures to ground faults, deteriorative phenomena and some detection methods for initial contact failure conditions. A summary of this study is as follows: (1) The contact resistances are greatly dependent on the materials and construction of contacts. (2) The relation between the initial contact resistance and the carried current resulting in arcing is derived with approximately constant Joule‐heat generation. (3) Ground faults result from sagging of a shield melted by arcing or a combination of two causes: (i) scattering of molten metal caused by arcing; and (ii) sagging of a conductor caused by bolt melt down. (4) To detect initial contact failures, it is recommended to observe the contact resistance, the temperature rise on the tank surface, or the electrical partial discharges.

The 620,000 sq ft hospital will be eight stories, plus basement. Total cost is estimated to be 60 million. This article discusses the design and operation of the service switchgear that was used to meet engineering criteria, satisfy code requirements and provide the demand-shaving capability required by project parameters. Initial design criteria for the hospital's electrical systems had to meet the rigid requirements of both the national and city electrical codes, and yet be flexible enough to meet the energy conservation guide for the construction of state-funded buildings. The nature of the operation and functions of a teaching hospital make it virtually impossible to apply conventional energy management systems and practices to the electrical systems."

The explosion destroyed an electrical substation building containing switchgear and motor controllers. This paper briefly describes the accident itself, the source of the gas leakage and cause of the explosion. Details of the seal and conduit system redesign are discussed along with a report on the present status of changes to the National Electrical Code and the NFPA-59A standard. It is suggested that all equipment which depends on a seal, diaphragm, or any other single barrier (such as a thermowell) to prevent flammable gases or liquids from entering electrical conduit or cable-pumps, pressure transducers, flow transducers, valve operators, etc - be checked to ensure that a positive means exists to prevent fluids from entering an area where contacts may be present. Finally, conduit seals, such as the Crouse Hinds Model EYS if used, should not be relied upon as a positive stop for liquids or gases under pressure."
809,Belmont Thomas K.,CALCULATED GUIDE FOR SELECTING STAND-BY BATTERIES.,1979,Specifying Engineer,"Lead-acid and nickel-cadmium systems are the two secondary battery systems evaluated most often for stand-by service. One of the most important characteristics of a secondary battery is the number of times it can be recharged. Nickel-cadmium batteries typically can be recharged up to several thousand times. They can be recharged at a wide range of rates from a float charge of milliamperes to an ″overnight″ charge of 8 to 12 hours; ″quick charge″ in 4 to 6 hours to a ″fast charge″ in as little as 15 minutes. In applications where batteries are in float stand-by service with infrequent deep discharges, battery life can be 25 to 30 years. This longevity is also accompanied by immunity to sudden catastrophic performance failures which demonstrates a very high demand reliability that is so vital in stand-by power systems. Nickel-cadmium pocket plate batteries for stand-by battery systems exhibit high rate discharge performance for applications demanding a heavy surge of current for short periods such as engine/turbine starting, switchgear control, inverter supply, etc. Acid reaction creates a number of potential problem areas common to almost all types of lead-acid construction, and leads to increasing degradation of battery performance reliability in time."

It follows from the economical reasons that these plants should, make use of so far existing dams with total head 3 m, and have simple technical solutions (1 generating set with high rotating speed and no high voltage switchboard). It is assumed that SWPS will consist mostly of flow power plants capable of work in their own network The continued use of stations with Kaplan and Francis turbines until the year 2000 is suggested, together with the use of Banka type flow microturbines.

The resulting fire burned for 2 days, fueled by gasoline and fuel oil leaking from many burned-out flange gaskets, from drainage from hundreds of feet of pipe connecting 37 tanks, and from the receiving and loading rack manifolds. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was the fracture of the base of a 30-year-old cast-iron pump which had not been hydrostatically tested at its new installation. The failure allowed gasoline under pressure to spray, vaporize, and enter an electric switchgear building 50 feet away. Ignition occurred from an electric arc produced by opening a switch. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the company to (1) utilize explosion-proof equipment in a potentially hazardous vapor area, and (2) fill the gap between the pump and its foundation with grout.

The line/trunk groups are microprocessor-controlled units which form the interface between the subscriber lines or trunks on one side and the switching network on the other. They perform the major switching functions automatically. The number of line/trunk groups is decisive for the size of the associated exchange. The coordination processor performs those tasks which require access to the central data base (e. g. routing tables) or to input/output units (e. g. magnetic disk). With the digital concentrator, the digital switchboard, the control unit for the common signaling channels (CCITT No. 7) and the operation and maintenance center, further functional units are available to complement the system. They allow an optimal and economical adaptation of the EWSD system to new network and service features. EWSD exchanges can be installed in telecommunication buildings and in containers."

It applies to all types of FBA - stationary, movable, with or without enclosures, special and domestic. Essentially, BS5486 looks at safety from three angles: the protection afforded by the enclosure; protection against shock in normal service; and protection against shock in the event of a fault. Another standard, BS5420: 1977 (IEC144: 1963, gives two scales for degrees of protection of enclosures. One scale - from 0 to 6 - covers the protection of people from contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure, and protection against the ingress of foreign bodies. The degrees range from no protection at all on either count (0) to complete personnel protection and no ingress of dust (6). The other scale - for the protection of enclosed equipment from liquid ingress - provides nine gradings, starting with no protection at 0 and concluding, at 8, with a rating for an enclosure that will effectively withstand water ingress during indefinite immersion at a specific pressure."

This voltage-controlled switch is an 8-port device coupled by GRINrod lenses to four input fibers and to four output fibers (graded index, 50-um core diameter). The matrix switches light from any input to any output, and four simultaneous input-output connections are made. There are 24 such states. Switching is done via controlled reflection from two layers of nematic liquid crystal. This switch is the first multimode, electro-optic, fiber-optic matrix. Construction is simple and compact, using only four glass prisms and two liquid crystal layers. The matrix architecture is based on a new dual-switching-array concept that provides very low levels of optical crosstalk, more than 53 dB below the optical input level. The 5-ms on/off response time is faster than that of electro-mechanical matrices, although the 40 Vrms addressing voltage is higher. The optical insertion loss had a minimum value of 6 dB and an average value of 15 dB. The latter is due to misalignment of fibers during attachment to the switch, which can be remedied. Because the present switch does not use moving parts, it is quite reliable. © 1982 SPIE. All rights reserved."

The application of SDMS significantly reduces hardware such as cables, switchboards, and Signal Data Converters (SDC), and it provides the capability to add many desired features which are currently not practicable. In applying SDMS to a specific ship, a massive amount of signal data must be considered. The Application Design Automation Program (ADAP) is a set of computer programs that have been developed to accomplish this task. ADAP com bines signal population data, ships configuration data, and SDMS hardware characteristics to produce an SDMS configuration layout together with documentation necessary to analyze, evaluate, and implement the system. Specific outputs include hardware requirements, system layout, and interface requirements including wire list information. The Timing, Event and Load Simulation (TELS) Program simulates SDMS and provides performance data (system capacity, throughput rate, transport delays) for any system configuration. Conventional SDCs can be elimianted from Navy shipboard systems when SDMS is used. SDMS provides the necessary data distribution, signal conversion, and computer interface. In addition, many functions of the conventional switchboards can be performed within SDMS, thus reducing the size or eliminating conventional switchboards. Very small switch‐bomb will provide the necessary control of data distribution. With SDMS, an automatic and continuous Noise and Vibration Monitoring (NVM) capability is readily available. The automated NVM function will enhance the safety, operation, and maintenance of the ship. Problems with machinery or excessive self‐noise generation will be detected much sooner, and corrective action implemented on a timely basis. © 1979 American Society of Naval Engineers"

899,Karrenbauer Herbert,METAL-CLAD SF6-INSULATED SWITCHGEAR FOR SERVICE VOLTAGES OF 420 AND 525 kV.,1978,AEG Telefunken Prog,A system of metal-clad SF//6-insulated switchgear (Type VIS) for 420 kV and 525 kV is introduced that augments the installations in service for many years for the lower voltage levels. The well-proven modular concept behind this type of switchgear was retained unchanged also for the higher voltages. The basic construction of the switchgear and the operation and interaction of the individual units are described as well as the possibility of connecting electrical apparatus with other forms of insulation. With the aid of several examples the far-reaching capacity for adaptation to different boundary conditions is demonstrated.

Current relays with conduction-type MHD pumps can be made with and without self-resetting for currents up to several thousand amperes. There have been made relays with instantaneous action and with a time lag, power relays, voltage relays, and polarized relays. A description of their constructions and principal parameters is given. Relays with induction-type MHD pumps differ by the absence of a galvanic connection between the controlled and controlling circuits and by the possibility of building devices for protection against phase cutoff and an undesirable order of the phase sequence. The weight and dimensions of MHD relays usually do not exceed their values for the analogous electromagnetic or semiconductor devices, and compact MHD apparatus frequently surpasses its analogs with respect to these indices. Investigations have been made of the MHD elements of automatic equipment, specifically, a multipoint switch. Such a switch can commutate very weak signals without interference in accordance with various programs. MHD stations for control of an axisynchronous motor make it possible to reduce considerably the number of pieces of equipment and to decrease the weight and dimensions of the whole complex. The article discusses the possibilities of MHD pickups for nonelectrical quantities and of MHD model of various processes. Electrical measuring instruments have been developed and tested, specifically, an automatic recording ammeter for recording shadowgraphs of the currents in power circuits."

Unfortunately it is located in a “no-man’s land” between the electric power company’s system and the low-voltage system. Much better understanding of the disadvantages and danger in providing a single 6000-18 000-ampere service entrance into a building is needed by electric power company engineers, low-voltage system consultants, and code-making authorities. Some codes and authorities are still insisting on a single service entrance into a building with little consideration of the possibility of loss of power to the entire building due to an arcing burndown or of the problem of high operating temperatures in these special high-current services. This paper shows how, in one case, arcing protection for the service entrance busway and switchboard was provided by using a groundfault relay to trip four network protectors.

942,Borst D.W.,Sealed Ignitron Rectifiers for Urban Transit Power Supply,1951,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"Today, the mercury arc rectifier has virtually superseded the older forms of conversion equipment for supplying power to trolley coach and street railway transit systems. The present trend when selecting a rectifier rated 1,000 kw or less is to choose the sealed ignitron type. The sealed ignitron rectifier is metal-enclosed, which makes possible a unit substation type of equipment when it is combined with metal-enclosed switchgear. This gives increased safety to personnel and a reduction in installation cost. A number of substation arrangements are possible, including installation of part or even all of the equipment outdoors in weatherproof enclosures, thus reducing building costs. Operating experience with close to 4,000 sealed ignitron tubes has demonstrated that they can be expected to have an average life of at least six years. Their 1-minute rating of 200 per cent load is more than adequate to handle an urban transit load composed of a number of small increments, where diversity serves to reduce the magnitude of peak swings. In keeping with the smaller equipment ratings possible with sealed ignitrons, light-duty switchgear has been introduced having the necessary current and interrupting ratings at lower initial cost. The high reliability of rectifiers makes it possible in many cases to install a single-unit substation where before two smaller conversion units would have been used. Operators are beginning to recognize this and to take advantage of the savings this accomplishes. Where larger concentrations of power are required than can be provided by a single 1,000-kw rectifier, two or more sealed ignitron rectifiers may be operated in parallel. Heavy-duty drawout metal-enclosed switchgear is available for such installations. If the ultimate bus capacity of the installation exceeds 2,250 kw, high-speed switchgear should be used to protect the rectifier transformers from excessive winding stresses during arc backs.

Because of their simple construction with functional subassemblies and good visibility of important components, they readily meet the demands of the users and of those responsible for erection, inspection and checking. Taking this switchgear as an example it is obvious that in addition to the development of novel switching station concepts a continuous improvement of conventional switchgear is desirable, too."

The main components of the reactor plant inside a spherical containment within the reactor building are: the nuclear steam generating system, including the reactor pressure vessel with two once-through steam generators, four main coolant pumps and the pressurizer, and the storage basins for new and spent fuel elements with the associated handling gear. The auxiliaries building, which is directly connected to the reactor building, houses the air and water radwaste system, the equipment for decontamination and storage of radioactive wastes, as well as the ″hot″ workshop in which radioactive components of the reactor can be handled. The machine house contains the main components of the steam power plant, including the turboset, the two reheaters, the feed-heaters and the condenser.

An economic evaluation of 13. 8 and 34. 5 kV distribution will be examined for a typical refinery distribution system. However, the selection of a particular voltage level cannot be generalized and each system should be considered individually. It appears that 13. 8 kV distribution is usually the most economical for refineries at present. The 34. 5 kV distribution system is attractive for large spot loads and long distances. With the 34. 5 kV enclosed switchgear gaining acceptance, a larger selection of switching equipment will become available and limit some of the short coming of this line of equipment.

959,Smith M.E.,Recent changes in the astron fast pulsing system,1971,IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science,"Two major changes were made in the Astron Fast-Pulsing System since June 1970. The hard-tube modulators used to charge the accelerator PFN's have been changed to a resonant-charge system and completely rebuilt. While no comparative reliability records are available, it is obvious that the new system is at least ten times more reliable than the old system. The pulse-to-pulse regulation of the new system is not as good as was hoped for, but it seems to be adequate for reasonable performance of the accelerator. Furthermore, significant improvement should be simple and of negligible cost. The second major change was the building of a new power supply for the core-reset system. The old system had relatively poor voltage regulation (15 or 20%). Two problems existed - the power supply and cabling system were inherently poorly regulated, and an already too small substation was shared with another pulsed load of comparable size. Instead of about 90 small power supplies, the new system uses one large series-pass transistor supply, operated on its own 1.5 MVA substation. The new supply consists of a 340-v brute-force rectifier unit with a 1-F capacitor bank, followed by a series-pass transistor bank (about 2,000 transistors) feeding a distributed 1.3-F bank at 260 V. Rated output current is 7500 A. Output voltage is sensed at the most distant part of the load and a loop gain of 1,000 is planned for the system. The major components are completed and the substation and 13.8-kV switchgear are installed and have been tested at no load. The transistor bank is now being tested in small segments. Completion of the new system is expected in May of this year. Copyright © 1971 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc."

The ever increasing collaboration with neighboring countries within the framework of Nordel is gradually being taken more into consideration. During the next two decades, the annual cost of 800 kv will be greater than that for an alternative continued extension of the 400 kv system. However, important reasons, above all environmental considerations, speak for an early introduction of an 800 kv system. A decision to commission the first 800 kv constructions around 1980 is expected shortly. The main technical data for such a system has already been decided on. A relatively low insulation level is possible owing to technical developments in circuit-breakers, surge arresters and shunt reactors, among other items. The lines will be designed for a load of 4,000 to 6,000 Mw. It is most probable that metal-enclosed SF//6-insulated switchgear will be widely applied, as will three-phase transformers. Great consideration will be taken with regard to environmental aspects."

997,Lott Donald L.,SURGE-SUPPRESSING RESISTORS APPLIED TO EHV DISCONNECT SWITCHES.,1975,Allis-Chalmers Eng Rev,"As transmission voltages have increased, surge resistors have been added to circuit breakers and disconnect switches to limit switching transients. The most common applications of surge resistors to disconnect switches have been for deenergizing bus and short line sections at 345 and 500 kV. Without resistors, severe stresses can be imposed on lightning arresters and terminal equipment by line-to-neutral crest voltages ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 5 per unit (pu), where the base for the pu value is nominal crest line to ground voltage. Multiple sparkovers exceeding arrester ratings have been recorded. Surge voltages can also be induced in adjacent low-voltage power and control circuits with the possibility of causing equipment failure. Usually, the value of resistance is selected to limit the switching-surge voltage to less than 1. 8 pu. Resistance values three to five times the system surge impedance have become somewhat of an industry standard. A typical surge resistor consists of a 500- OMEGA Nichrome resistor element wound on an epoxy core mandrel and silver brazed to bronze end inserts. This assembly is encapsulated in the same epoxy, then put in a porcelain housing for environmental protection. The top end cap is sealed to the mounting flange and the bottom cap is relieved to permit breathing action. This construction provides a totally encapsulated resistor and permits re-coring."

999,Kennon Richard,FAULT CURRENT LIMITERS: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.,1976,EPRI Journal,"The extra cost of series-connected electrical equipment is prohibitive if designed for the higher fault levels anticipated. A reliable fault current limiter (FCL) must be developed before utilities can be expected to specify transformers, switchgear, switches, cable, and supporting hardware that are not fully rated to withstand high fault current stresses. EPRI is therefore sponsoring R&D that will produce one or more technically feasible designs for fault current limiters. Two basic schemes for fault current limiting are briefly discussed, namely, tuned circuits, and switched impedances. Studies have been undertaken of different sensing criteria, such as magnitude of current, rate of change of current, the time integral of current squared, and combinations of these. It is likely that a combination current magnitude and its rate of change will enable accurate fault sensing in approximately 1-2 milliseconds with low probability of false operation. Further analysis and the construction of a prototype are planned."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS.,1973,Fr Railw Tech,"The building of an experimental chopper of high tractive power (4400 kw, 6000 metric hp), the conditions under which it was tested and the results obtained are described. The experimental vehicles include two locomotives coupled mechanically and electrically. The first unit (cc 20002) carries the pantograph, driving console, main circuit breaker, power chopper and auxiliary circuits. The choppers, operating in the staggered pulse condition, deliver to a common bus bar and supply the four motors of the second unit (BB 9252) coupled in parallel through a high-voltage cable. The nominal operating frequency of the chopper is 300 Hz, divided by 27, 9 and 3 for starting purposes, and was chosen so that the harmonics would not interfere with track signaling frequencies. During the period of the tests, the two locomotives, CC 20002 and BB 9252, ran 2600 km without the slightest incident, in spite of the severity of the starts during which the current delivered by the chopper corresponded to the permissible limit of the motors of locomotive BB 9252 (say a total of 4000A). This experimental stage yielded all the information expected and is considered to be completely finished. The chopper equipment removed from locomotive CC 20002 can now be supplemented by the additional items needed for its installation in a BB 15000 locomotive, which would then be the first high powered chopper locomotive in the world. The application of the chopper is not limited to d. c. machines. Dual-system motive-power units can be designed simply by providing a transformer and rectifier on the input side of the chopper."

The design is a new departure from customary engineering practise in that all live parts are immersed in oil and enclosed in metal housings with each phase in its own independent compartment. The switchgear insures maximum safety to the operating and maintenance personnel and reduces construction costs for power station switching. The design is well adapted to mass production which should lead toward standardization resulting in a material savings in cost of manufacturing. Copyright 1930. By A. I. E. E.

The current-limiting fuse meets these requirements for it is inherently a high-interrupting-capacity fuse of low current rating and can be totally enclosed in a small space. The theory and construction of previous current-limiting fuses are briefly described. The theory and construction of a new current-limiting fuse is given.

In the past, this protection has been provided by knife switches and fuses. Limited interrupting capacity of knife switches, together with the possibility of abuse of the fuse, has made it impossible to obtain these desirable characteristics. Increase in design knowledge, the development of new materials, together with an increase in knowledge of arc phenomena, and of arc interrupters has made possible the construction of circuit breakers occupying small space. These same devices are capable of rendering performance superior to that given by older apparatus. At the same time, low cost to the user is obtained, together with safer and more satisfactory service. Safety construction of apparatus, together with tests of unusual severity, assure a product capable of providing a degree of protection to property and life which is considerably more than that obtained from knife switches and fuses, which in many cases can be tampered with and handled while the circuit is alive. The new circuit breakers are suitable for very broad application in all varieties of distribution circuits within the scope of their rating. Standardization of dimensions provides for economical application. The scope of application of these devices is the field now filled by knife switches and fuses, together with many applications in which small oil and carbon circuit breakers are now used. This field in general includes such applications as switchboards, panelboards, load centers, meter entrance equipment, and enclosed switches. Copyright 1933. By A. I. E. E."

An attempt is made to outline the elementary features of construction for successful operation by enumerating the factors which must be known. A method of obtaining the proper transformer capacity, types of switches for changing the amount of welding current, and means for regulating the time of application of the current are indicated. Important mechanical conditions to be considered are also touched upon. This is followed by a description of the construction features of a few outstanding resistance welding machines of special design used at the Hawthorne Plant of the Western Electric Company.

1005,Moultrop I.E.; Pope J.,Some Engineering Features of the Weymouth Station of The Edison Electric Illuminating Co. of Boston,1923,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"Review of the Subject.—The new power station of The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston, now under construction on the Weymouth Fore River is expected to have an ultimate capacity of about 300,000 kw. The present construction covers the installation of two 32,000 kw. generating units with three 1974-h. p. boilers, operating at 375 lb. steam pressure and 700 deg. fahr. In addition, a single boiler to carry steam at pressures up to 1200 lb. is to be installed. This boiler will have about the same heating surface as the normal pressure boilers. The steam generated by it will pass through a pressure reducing turbine developing about 2000 kw., and will be exhausted at 375 lb. pressure. After being reheated to the original temperature of 700 deg. the steam will be piped to the main header and used in the large turbines. If satisfactory results are obtained from the higher-pressure boiler-turbine units more of them will be installed. Three will be required to furnish sufficient steam to operate one of the 32,000-kw. units. The maximum steam temperature was fixed at 700 deg. in consideration of the properties of materials at the higher temperatures. While the theoretical gain from higher pressure increases up to the maximum for which any data are available, the full benefit of the thermodynamic possibilities are not at present obtainable in practise without reheating the steam at some point intermediate between the throttle and the condenser. Without reheating, the most advantageous steam pressure, both practically and economically considered, seems to be about 375 lb. gage. With reheating, it appears that about 1200 lb. is a practicable initial pressure, and that 375 lb. is an entirely satisfactory pressure at which to reheat. Accordingly a combination of these two pressures with intermediate reheating has been adopted; the higher pressure with a view to developing its possibilities, the lower pressure with the feeling that it represents the best practise in the single expansion cycle and that operation solely at that pressure will give highly economical results. The character of the future development of the plant will depend upon the relative performance of the two classes of equipment. Feed water is to be heated by two-stage bleeding of the main units and by economizers. All normally running auxiliary equipment is to be driven by alternating-current motors. Power for driving the essential auxiliaries is to be supplied from a 2300-volt alternator of 2500 kv-a. capacity connected directly to each 30,000-kw. main generator shaft, and thus driven by the main turbine, which will have sufficient capacity for driving both generators at full load. This arrangement is expected to give a combination of greater economy and security than any heretofore used. The switch house will be a separate structure, four stories and basement. The upper floor will carry the switchboard and the switch operating mechanism. The three lower stories will house the bus structures, oil circuit breakers and reactors, each phase being isolated to a single floor. The basement will serve as a cable vault and all incoming and outgoing circuits will pass through it. There will be two main ring busses and a transfer bus. The ring busses will be divided into sections, each section fed by two generators and with current-limiting reactors between sections. All circuits will be connected to the busses through two oil circuit breakers in series. No prediction is made of the expected operating performance of the station, but it is calculated that under ideal conditions, acting solely as a 375-lb. single-expansion nonreheating plant, it could produce a net kw-hr. for 1,5,100 B. t. u. in the fuel and as a 1200 lb. compound reheating plant, it could produce a net kw-hr. for 13,600 B. t. u. These figures show the advance in heat economy that modern developments in steam engineering have made possible and the advantage which the very high-pressure reheat cycle possesses over the more conventional design. The actual plant performance will depend among other things upon the character of the load which it is found possible to put on Weymouth Station and the relative proportion of high and normal pressure equipment that may be operated. ©, 1923 by the AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS"
1006,MATTHEWS G.A.,Power Arc-Over on Overhead Distribution Lines and Newly Developed Equipment for Protection Against Conductor Burndown From That Cause,1941,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"With conventional types of switchgear and customary methods of circuit operation, power arc-overs resulting from transient faults on overhead primary lines cause unnecessary burndown of conductors and undesired operation of fuses. The majority of faults on overhead distribution circuits are of transient nature. Factual data concerning arcing characteristics of covered and bare conductors were established by tests conducted under field conditions. They show that to prevent burndown of covered wire and to hold the arc damage within admissible limits, power arcs must be limited to one-half- to two-cycle (sixty-cycle basis) over-all time, depending upon size of conductor and arc current. Bare conductors are less liable to serious arc damage owing to the phenomenon of arc travel and to the self-extinguishing characteristics of arcs on such conductors. However, the duration of traveling arcs is sufficient to cause undesired operation of sectionalizing fuses unless the line is rapidly de-energized. Speeds of operation required to protect covered wire are also ample to assure against operation of fuses on transient faults. New switching devices capable of meeting the required one-half- to two-cycle initial circuit clearance have been developed as part of this project. They also provide for automatic reclosure and a sequence of time-delay openings and reclosures before lockout. Simplicity of construction, ease of installation, and self-actuating principles which dispense with auxiliary power requirements, make investment sufficiently low to bring these devices within the realm of practicability for low revenue distribution circuits as well as the more important distribution circuits. They are adaptable to existing and new circuits alike. © 1941 SDAIEEE"
1007,Barfoed S.,Hydroelectric Practises and Equipment on the Pacific Coast,1924,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"Review of the Subject.—The paper takes up the physical features having deciding influence on design and construction of hydroelectric plants. It describes the mountain system of the region, the precipitation, the runoff, the streams suitable for power development, and the major characteristics of the development; then takes up a little more in detail the structural features, such as reservoirs and diversion dams, the conduit system, surge tanks and forebays, pressure pipes, power houses and equipment. The choice of impulse and reaction turbines is discussed and some performance curves given; this followed by conditions imposed upon modern plants by the transmission line; switch gear is briefly discussed, followed by a resume on transmission lines and their control. Finally, some results which have been obtained are related, and the paper ends up with the hope that hydroelectric developments and distribution will continue as in the past, rather than have it undertaken by competing municipalities, which by ambitious advertising of cheap power (tax free) would endeavor to attract industries and people to their crowded areas. It is felt that the hydroelectric power industry on the Pacific Coast has distributed the benefits of cheap electricity to the small and large community alike, tending to more stable development of the entire region. ©, 1924 by the American Institiute of Electrical Engineers"

Central offices of the crossbar type can be introduced in panel areas without changes in existing offices and without changes in existing dial telephone instruments. Crossbar offices and panel offices in the same building will operate on a common power plant and utilize other equipment in common, such as “A” and “B” operator switchboards and outgoing trunks. The precious metal contact crossbar switches are used for all switching purposes as contrasted with the base metal contact panel switches. The switches operate with relay‐like movements under control of common control or marker circuits consisting primarily of multi‐contact, U and Y type relays. The control and marker circuits, which are connected to the switch frames by means of multi‐contact relays, perform their operations in a fraction of a second. The switches, the U and Y type relays and the multi‐contact relays are equipped with twin contacts of precious metal. Senders similar to those of the panel system are employed.

1010,HARRISON W.H.,Recent Developments in Toll Telephone Service,1930,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"This paper deals principally with the physical and technical phases of the development in recent years of “toll” telephone service in this country, with particular emphasis on the longer haul or “long distance” traffic. The very rapid growth in toll telephone business has required a rapid extension of toll plant including outside plant, buildings, and switchboard and other equipment. The most striking developments in the outside plant are very great growth in toll cable networks and the rapid extension of the carrier telephone systems. The factors involved in the relative use of these various types of plant are discussed. An outline is given of the advance planning and study necessary to insure that these annual programs are properly engineered so that, as closely as possible, they will effectively anticipate future requirements and extensions in a most suitable and practicable manner. The more important limitations affecting the design of toll plant from the standpoints of the efficiency, quality, speed, and length of telephone transmission and the specific treatments of each are generally discussed in the paper. These include such matters as the use of loading coils, vacuum tube repeaters, equalizers for attenuation and phase distortion, and means for reducing the effects of echoes and time lag or delay in the circuits. Mention is also made of modifications of the open wire plant to effect material reductions in crosstalk and to thereby permit a substantial increase in the use of carrier telephone facilities. The paper discusses the extension of toll service to include connection with the telephone networks in other countries including Canada, Mexico, Europe, Cuba, and South America. © 1930. By A. I. E.

1011,Clarke C.W.E.,Industrial Power,1939,"Journal of Fluids Engineering, Transactions of the ASME","This paper covers briefly the progress that has been made in the generation of power in industrial plants. The author points out that industries and utilities are cooperating in the generation and interchange of electric energy in order to reduce waste in many manufacturing processes. Higher steam pressures and temperatures are widely used, along with superposition of new turbines on old equipment. Only a few installations have pressures and temperatures which exceed 900 lb per sq in. and 850 F, respectively. A number of prominent industrial plants are described to indicate the application of all types of steam turbines to the three steam cycles most commonly employed. Steam-pressure-reducing and desuperheating equipment, as developed for topping units in central stations, is finding new applications in industry. Where large quantities of process steam are needed, many interesting arrangements of modern equipment can be used to reduce the cost of power generation. The trend in design of boilers is toward larger units, higher steaming rates, and more complicated automatic controls to permit utilization of several different kinds of fuel in the same furnace. This presupposes the proper treatment of boiler feedwater, the importance of which is emphasized. Operating data from two outstanding installations are included. Among smaller plants there is a tendency toward the use of a self-contained boiler; also, there has been a revival of semi-outdoor constructions. Progress is being made toward better utilization of unusual fuels, such as pulverized anthracite culm, lignite, acid sludges, and black liquor, the latter of which is obtained in the process of manufacturing kraft paper. Improvements in electrical equipment for industrial plants include metal-clad switchgear, which may be located in any available space; also, air circuit breakers for voltages up to 5000 may soon be available in order to eliminate the fire hazard from using oil. Modern insulation on wire and cable offers greater resistance to high temperatures and the effects of moisture and other harmful substances.  Copyright © 1939 by ASME."
1012,Hunt F.L.,Outdoor substations in New England,1914,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"The present development of outdoor switching apparatus and transformers for systems of 110,000 volts or less is such as to make their use entirely successful, and in most transformer substations, a considerable saving in first cost can be accomplished without increase in operating expenses, by making use of this type of equipment. This paper gives a brief description of two substations of 10,000 kv-a. ultimate capacity, just put into operation, in which all the high-tension switching apparatus (66,000 volts) and the transformers are outdoors. The low-tension apparatus (13,200 volts) and the railway apparatus are indoors. This arrangement is based on the three following principles which have in this case proved to be sound: 1. That the greatest saving in building cost can be made by putting all high-tension work outdoors. 2. That the switching apparatus, lightning arresters and transformers of voltages in the neighborhood of 66,000 volts are practical and may be successfully operated outdoors in New England. 3.

1014,Edson W.W.,Automatic Transformer Substations Of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston,1929,Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,"The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston has adopted a policy of numerous relatively small automatic a-c. substations located at the various individual load centers, this policy being enhanced by the development of a new method of automatic control and by the standardization of the station design. The rating of a substation is based on the sum of three specially designed transformers each having an inherent 50 per cent overload capacity. Thus, the maximum load is normally carried by the three units operating at their nominal 100 per cent rating, but in emergencies the load can be handled by two banks, the transformer out of service, representing only 33 per cent of the station capacity instead of 50 per cent as in the usual case. The automatic control consists essentially of load-current relays which switch in or out the follow-up transformers as needed. This operating point for maximum station efficiency equals [formula omitted]. Serious trouble on any bank will bring in the succeeding transformer. Each transformer has its own sequence switch so that it may be made leading, follow-up, second following, or manual, irrespective of the set-up for the remaining units. The simplicity of this control equipment is particularly interesting; in fact only the current control and one auxiliary relay are directly chargeable to the automatic control. The circuits and apparatus have several special features promoting safety and reliability. The construction of these stations has been standardized by the development of standard “blocks“ complete in themselves and suitable for being arranged or added, as desired. Thus, for each transformer section there are four types of blocks-high-tension, low-tension, regulator, and switchboard. Such an arrangement offers the advantages of complete segregation of equipment, flexibility in station layout, efficient provision for growth, standardization of engineering and construction, and the satisfactory use of complete bills of material. This system of control and standardization of construction has been applied to five new automatic transformer substations in the last two years, and the results have been very satisfactory.
